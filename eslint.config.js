// as "a readout for humans and for drivers — never a thing to branch on", and
// this is the machine half of that sentence. The seam asks what CAN BE DONE
// here; branching on WHAT IS RUNNING this throws away capability in both
// directions — `platform.name === 'electron'` would have killed #204's
// choose-a-display feature in every browser (Chromium answers it with
// `getScreenDetails()`), and it is the one line that makes the later web port
// impossible. A capability the seam cannot yet answer needs a new METHOD with an
// honest weak answer, not a host test at the call site.
//
// Shared rather than repeated because flat config REPLACES `no-restricted-syntax`
// wholesale when a later block re-declares it: the #61 ratchet below covers three
// files that are also under `src/**`, so it has to carry this entry itself or
// those three would silently lose the ban.
