// The deep layers of the CS teaching corpus: hand-authored subtopics BELOW
// the 53 edge-bearing topics in graph.ts. Pure data — graph.ts attaches these
// under each topic (ids chain parent-id + title slug) and merges the `d`
// blurbs into the document bodies. Typed edges never reach down here: depth
// is containment only, which is exactly what the vertical instruments
// (tree, drill, cockpit) disclose.
//
// Shape: every topic gets 2–4 subtopics (level 5); EVERY subtopic decomposes
// into at least two concepts (level 6 — the depth floor, so no branch dies at
// 5); every topic's subtree reaches level 7 somewhere; and ONE flagship spine
// per domain reaches level 8 — ragged at the tips on purpose, because real
// curricula are. The six spines:
//   sys  Virtual Memory → Paging → Page Tables → Multi-Level → x86-64 Walk
//   math Graph Theory → Spanning Structures → MSTs → Cut & Cycle → Exchange
//   cs   Sorting & Searching → Comparison Sorts → Quicksort → Partitioning → Lomuto vs. Hoare
//   net  TCP & UDP → Congestion Control → Loss-Based → CUBIC → Window Growth
//   sec  Public-Key → RSA → Key Generation → Prime Selection → Miller–Rabin
//   se   Version Control → Git Internals → Object Model → Packfiles → Delta Compression
