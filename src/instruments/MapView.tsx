// Map — the "territory at every level" instrument, and the Studio's only map.
// It ABSORBED the flat MapView in 25734fa ("one map"), which is why this file
// carries that name again: same geography as that one (same embedding, same
// countries and provinces), but EVERY node owns
// a convex territory that its children tile exactly (model/nested.ts), so
// zooming discloses region tiers in place.
//
// SNAP-ONLY + NODE-AS-COUNTRY (2026-07-12): free zooming is gone — the wheel
// steps whole levels, double-click dives one, so every frame the user sees is
// one of the L0..maxTier canonical scales and each level is an AUTHORED style,
// not an interpolated in-between (this is what removed the mid-transition
// artifacts and the unreadable type of the free-zoom era). At level k the
// level-k nodes ARE the countries: pale tree-color fill (model/color.ts),
// own label — wrapped to fit inside the cell, or dropped when even the best
// two-line split overflows (2026-07-13: capital dots removed with the same
// stroke — fill + border + name already said "a node lives here" three ways)
// — and the ONLY hit targets: clicking a cell selects that node, never its
// ancestor. Ancestors follow ONE formal rule — the
// CONTEXT WINDOW (below): only the immediate parent grain (d = level − tier
// = 1) renders at all, as a full-emphasis border plus one watermark ghost;
// every grain above it disappears entirely. Branches
// that bottom out early persist as leaf countries at
// every deeper level, slightly muted ("no more depth here") — jagged
// hierarchies never leave holes in the map.
//
// Relations stay a SELECTION overlay, drawn AT THE SELECTED LEVEL
// (2026-07-13): edges live at the topic grain, so a selection above it (a
// domain or module) ROLLS ITS EDGES UP — every underlying topic edge maps to
// the counterpart's region at the same tier, and edges internal to the
// selection drop. Children's relationships are never drawn raw across a
// coarser map, and a selection BELOW the topic grain draws no roads at all
// (2026-07-17): a deep cell has no edges of its own, and borrowing the owning
// topic's made every relation-less child look connected — the selection tint
// is all it gets. The overlay is pinned until a re-click of the same cell, a
// water-click or Esc. All text and hairlines are sized in SCREEN pixels
// (pane-fit compensated) — at canonical scales the same style table renders
// identically at every level.
//
// ONE ROAD PER PAIR (2026-07-14): whatever the grain, every arrow between the
// same two cells COLLAPSES into a single line carrying a ×n traffic count.
// Before, four links between two topics were four curves fanned apart by a
// bulge index, and a reciprocal pair was two arrows bowed past each other —
// geometrically honest, cartographically unreadable. A map answers "is there a
// road here, and how busy is it"; one road, one number. A bundle of mixed types
// is drawn slate (no type color would be true), and a bundle running BOTH ways
// gets no arrowhead at all — which links, of which type, in which direction is
// the Connections star's question, and it is one pane away.

// The DERIVATION lives in model/atlas.ts (2026-07-14) — which roads a selection
// draws, how they roll up to a coarser grain, how parallel links collapse into
// one road. It is a pure function of the corpus and one id, it is the piece a
// walk route would reuse, and it has its own tests. What is left here is what a
// component should be: a camera, a hover, and a paint order.

// which is to say, only during a zoom flight, where it is ALREADY interpolating

//
//   the cost — a 350ms transition restarted ~16 times over a 260ms flight, on

//   738ms -> 428ms, and layouts 82 -> 33.

//   the bug — a transition does not only cost, it LAGS, and this one lagged

//   written, frame by frame through one flight: the gap peaked at 98.8% — the
//   line-work drawing at 1.72 units where the map had asked for 0.86, i.e. TWICE
//   the intended weight — and was still more than 1% out 587ms in, well over
//   double the length of the flight it was supposedly smoothing. With the property
//   removed the same sampling reads 0% on every frame. So this is a correctness
//   fix that happens to also be faster: there is no level change at which a width

// level and the pre-mounted next tier) is the fill layers' job, not the
// line-work's. Borders and labels both read from here, so the window cannot
// drift apart per layer.
// The window has exactly ONE local exception, and it is a reading exception,
// not a structural one: the single ghost the CURSOR is standing inside fades

 *
 *  The ghost is set in the region's OWN hue over that region's own fill, so it is
 *  tint on tint: at 0.15 it read as a stain rather than a word, and simply
 *  turning it up muddies into the fill instead of separating from it — more ink,
 *  still no edge. A white case gives the glyphs a boundary, and with one the same
 *  word carries at far less ink than it would need bare. So the opacity moves

  // can't MORPH. So we drive the whole gesture by hand: a portal ghost follows
  // the cursor, showing the cell's own outline while over the map and crossfading
  // into a node pill once it leaves the map (the "shape becomes a node" ask). On
  // as it moves we feed the road a stream of synthetic HTML5 `dragover`/`dragleave`
  // events at the cursor, and a `drop` on release — so the road's OWN handlers do
  // both the live preview caret AND the precise insertion (gaps, stages, branches)
  // verbatim, no reimplementation and no road refactor. A container id rides the
  // same path and lands as a plain visit (everything is a node). Only the SELECTED

  // takes the minimum. Any walk with one short hop in it resolves to exactly 8,

  // THE DS LEAVES BOTH CALLS TO US (its `done when` says so, the same split as
  // OB-090 point 2): which lines count as "close", and how far to bow them.
  //
  // WHICH: a walk is a PATH, so a stop has exactly two lines at it — the one
  // arriving and the one leaving. They run close when the walk DOUBLES BACK:
  // both the previous stop and the next lie in nearly the same direction from
  // this one, so the two shafts share a corridor. Under BOW_CLOSE_DEG apart,
  // measured outward from the shared pin, is that case. (Two lines can also run
  // close WITHOUT sharing a pin; the DS's checkable is the shared-pin case and
  // that is what this covers. Named here so the next reader knows it was a
  // scope decision, not an oversight.)
  //
  // WHICH WAY: the DS proposed alternating the sign between the pair. That is
  // right for two lines both POINTING AT a pin, and wrong here, because a
  // path's two lines travel in OPPOSITE directions through it — so ONE sign,
  // taken by both, sends them to opposite sides of the corridor. Which sign
  // that is depends on whether the next stop lies clockwise or anticlockwise of

              draws with. Deep stops still roll up to their visible ancestor

              already-pinned territory offsets clear of it rather than drawing a
              second number into the same mark.

              Both StepDot and NodeArrow are built assuming 1 unit is 1 real
              screen px — true for the road's authoring board, false here, where
              `view.s` is a live pan/zoom the rest of this map counter-scales
              away per-element via `px()`. Neither component takes a pre-scaled
              prop for that, so the correction moves to the wrapping transform
              instead: `scale(f / view.s)` cancels the ambient `scale(view.s)`
              this whole layer sits inside (see the outer <g> a few hundred
              lines up), leaving raw numbers inside behave exactly like real
              CSS px — which is what both components already assume.
