// Connections — WHAT THIS NODE CONTAINS, beside WHAT IT IS RELATED TO.
//
// Rebuilt whole 2026-09-06 (#253, DS OB-101 + OB-113) on the design system's
// `ConnectionsSplitPane`, replacing the 1276-line pane that drew a containment
// WHEEL and a relations STAR as two modes of one canvas with a list under it.
// The redesign is the owner-approved "Combined B3" frame: a breadcrumb over a
// resizable, collapsible split — the CONTAINS column (a filter over a pill tree)
// beside the RELATIONS column (this app's real graph in a slot, a hover/pin hint
// line, then relationship cards grouped by source and by target).
//
// WHAT THIS FILE STILL OWNS, now that the pane component owns every layout rule:
//   1. the corpus adapters — the containment tree, the decomposed relations, the
//      one-line summary the hover preview reads;
//   2. navigation — which node the pane is aimed at, and what a click means on
//      the shared bus;
//   3. the GRAPH SLOT. The design system deliberately ships no graph: every graph
//      in that project is a stand-in, so what is ported here is the
//      `ConnectionsGraphApi` CONTRACT and the drawing is ours — the same typed
//      relation star this pane has always drawn, at true map bearings, in the same
//      pan/zoom canvas.
//
// WHAT THE REHAUL RETIRED, deliberately, and each one is a decision rather than an
// omission:
//   · the internal ⇄ external MODE TOGGLE. The containment reading is a column
//     now, not a mode, so both readings are on screen at once and there is nothing
//     to switch between. `model/panegraph.ts` (the wheel's layout) has no caller
//     here any more.
//   · the external SUMMARY grain for a region (`regionStarFor(id, 'summary')`,
//     which rolled a region's outside links up to one arrow per other AREA). It
//     cannot compose with this pane: the whole mechanism here is that hovering a
//     card lights its node in the graph and the other way round, and those two
//     surfaces must therefore name the same ids. A summary node IS a region while
//     every card's target is a topic, so in that grain nothing would ever light
//     anything. A region draws its DETAILED star, whose nodes are topics.
//   · the pane-local ◀ ▶ HISTORY BUTTONS, moved out to the pane header's own
//     actions slot (`ConnectionsPaneActions`, mounted by `studio/instruments.tsx`)
//     — the split has no chrome row left to hold them, and nothing else in the app
//     offers back/forward over the focus.
//
// #22 IS NOT DECIDED HERE, and this file is where its decision was going to land.
// How Connections OPENS is still the safe state it has been since 9b0c585: you
// pick it from the sidebar or a preset, and nothing auto-reveals it. This rewrite
// adds no `bus.reveal` and removes none — the question that issue asks is exactly
// as open as it was.
//
// THE CLICK GRAMMAR, restated because the redesign changed one third of it:
//   hover  — lights, everywhere. A tree row, a card and a graph node all publish
//            the same id to the bus, so the map's territory lights with them.
//   click on a GRAPH node — PINS the card filter (spec, #253). It does not
//            navigate and it does not move the map's camera.
//   click on a CRUMB, a TREE ROW or a CARD's pill — re-roots the session there AND
//            flies the map to its territory. One gesture, which is what a crumb
//            click has always meant here; the old pane's separate look-only single
//            click has no surface left to live on, since a single click in the new
//            pane is the selection gesture.
