// The WALK EDITOR's road — a top-down node chart where the road may fork. A fork
// is a GROUP CARD with more than one variant. Its history: a tab strip (#19),
// then side-by-side comparator COLUMNS (#18). Since #70 the card shows ONE
// version at a time — the ACTIVE one — as a single column. The comparator and
// the ☑/☐ visibility namecard (#15 / 0005 D5) are retired: showing every version
// at once was the thing being simplified away. "Which version is shown" and
// "which version is active" are now the SAME thing, so the two channels collapse
// into one — `choices`/chosenIdx alone.
//
// A container — open or folded — is the DS VersionedGroup, hosted whole. Open, it
// runs in the DS's chrome-only mode (`bodySlot`): the component draws the well,
// the head (outline number · title · tally · fold/ungroup), the description, the
// version picker and its menu, the ancestry rail and the empty-version zone, and
// leaves the body EMPTY for the road to float the active version's steps into as
// board-level siblings. Retitle, describe, rename, switch, add and delete
// versions, fold and ungroup are the component's gestures, wired to ops on
// `authordraft` so undo/redo holds. The road never draws a head of its own now.
//
// The single column is the road (numbered, live arrows) when the container is on
// the road; off-road it's muted+faded with ghost arrows (the same onRoad/dim
// machinery a skipped optional uses).
//
// An OPTIONAL stop is drawn like any other but with a DASHED border and a DASHED
// arrow leading into it — the two signals that it may be skipped. There is no
// separate bypass rail any more; the dashed edge + inbound arrow carry it.
//
// Layout is arithmetic (measure → place): no DOM measurement, one SVG underlay
// for the walk arrows. Step nodes float as board-level siblings OVER each card,
// so no inner click bubbles into a parent.

     for the column: the road's arrows read as one interrupted line down one axis, and a

     through its own `joinBorder` static. Only the UNSET slot is the road's own box — nothing

              of the road's own <line>s and two <marker> heads.

              The road still OWNS the layout. It computes every gap arithmetically in one
              pass, so each arrow is PLACED from ARROW_METRICS rather than handed to a
              NodeChain — the chain wants to own order and slots as well, which is the
              same structural reason the open card needs `bodySlot`. Adopting the drawing
              settles the tone; it does not settle AGAP 26 against the chain's 22, which
              is a layout constant and stays open on #109.

              Two signals collapse into the DS's model on purpose:
                · the live shaft goes 2.5 -> 1.5, because NodeArrow strokes one width;
                · the ghost's own '4 3' dash is DROPPED. The DS reserves dashed for
                  CONDITIONAL, and on this road that already means `optional` — so a
                  second dash pattern meaning "off the road" was decoration, and two
                  dashes for two meanings is the thing the rule exists to stop.
              Off-road now reads in tone alone: quiet (--bark-400) against walk
              (--accent-walk). It was --text-3, which IS bark (--bark-500), one step
              darker than the system's quiet — not the "neutral grey" #113 H4 reports. */}
