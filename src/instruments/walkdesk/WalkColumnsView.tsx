// Walk·Columns as its own instrument (#20) — the tier columns lifted out of the
// Walk·Desk. It is a pure reading surface: one column per open tier, boxes
// joined by down-arrows in walk order, a dashed begat-edge from the stage box
// that opened the column to its right. Picking a stage drills; picking a visit
// folds back.
//
// It owns only its drill path. The road it reads comes from presented.ts, which
// resolves the SAME draft the walk editor writes.
