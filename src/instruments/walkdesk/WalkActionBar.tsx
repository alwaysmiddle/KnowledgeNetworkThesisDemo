// The Walk Editor's pane-local actions (#144 — OB-036's "PaneActionBar replaces
// WalkToolbox's floating tray" half). Mounted through the Instrument registry's
// `actionBar` slot (src/studio/instruments.tsx → src/studio/StudioView.tsx's `pane()`),
// not through WalkEditorView's own render tree — that is what lets `Pane` clip the
// bar's top corners to the frame's own arc, which a plain child sitting inside the
// scroller cannot get (see PaneActionBar.prompt.md).
//
// Reads the SAME module-level draft/road stores WalkEditorView does — authordraft.ts's
// own note explains why a singleton is the right shape here — rather than receiving
// state as a prop. The two are siblings under one Pane, not parent/child.
//
// Replaces WalkToolbox.tsx (#54) whole: the FloatingPanel wrapper, its persisted rect
// and its 2-column icon-only grid are gone along with it — a docked, labelled bar has
// no drag/resize/auto-hide of its own to carry.

// destroys them: a stale payload cannot say which build wrote it (none of the
// three stored shapes carries a version field), so the only way to learn what

// reload — it is printed before navigation, and the devtools console persists
