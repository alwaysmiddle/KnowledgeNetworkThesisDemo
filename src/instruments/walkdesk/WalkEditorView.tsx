// The WALK EDITOR (#21) — the surface you WRITE the plan on, and, parallel to it,
// the flat route that plan projects to.
//
// WAS `RailroadView.tsx`, instrument id `railroad`, until 2026-08-20. The old
// name was the DRAWING — a railroad diagram — and not the job. What this is, is
// where a walk gets written. The line is kept because two dated notes in
// `src/ds/PROVENANCE.json` cite the old filename, and a dated record is not a
// thing to rewrite — it would then lie about its own moment. This is what makes
// them resolve. `tools/walk-tiers-spike/RESULTS.md` is left alone for the same
// reason: it records what was decided in July, under July's name.
// The ROAD keeps its name throughout (`AuthorRoad`, `layoutRoad`,
// `data-road-root`): the road is the drawing this editor hosts, which is a
// different noun doing a different job.
//
// One view, one lane that ever branches:
//
//   the ROAD is the only view in the Studio that ever sees a branch. Forks fan
//   out into labelled lanes that rejoin below, optionals wear a bypass rail, and
//   the choice of which lane is "the road" lives here too, because it is an
//   authoring decision until a presentation surface reads the result.
//
//   the road's RECEIPT — resolveRoad() with the branch picked and the skipped
//   optionals dropped — is not a permanent second lane. It is the WalkPreview
//   slide-in below (0005 D9): opened on demand, overlaying the road rather than
//   splitting the pane. An always-visible receipt beside the road was tried and
//   retired (`ce08f09`); whether one comes back, and in what shape, is #27.
//
// It shares ONE draft with the palette (its own instrument since #21) through
// the module-level stores in authordraft.ts — see the note there for why a
// singleton is the right shape. Everything downstream still receives
// resolveRoad()'s linear walk (now shared as presented.ts's usePresentedRoad,
// so Walk·Columns/Walk·Stack/Walk·Viewer resolve the same draft the same way),
// and it IS published on bus.route (#14, closed) via usePublishPresentedRoute.
// The Map draws it as a path across the territory and Connections highlights
// along it.
