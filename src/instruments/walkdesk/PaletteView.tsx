// It is a stand-in for the map: the whole feed contract is `pal:<nodeId>` on
// text/plain, so the real map beside it is a dragstart handler away, not a
// redesign. The Plan preset now literally puts the two side by side, which
// is what the google-maps framing on #20 was asking for — the territory you can
// see, and the filtered list of what is in it.
//
// This wrapper exists to JOIN the bus (hover) and the shared draft; Palette
// itself is presentation plus two callbacks, and stays reusable.

  // the camera; peekAt publishes the LOOK that flies the camera to the node's
  // territory. Together they are "zoom in on the map as if we selected it there".
  // 'link' + jump tags the trail as a discontinuous leap — the same gesture
  // PlexPanel and LensPane already use to jump across the graph.
