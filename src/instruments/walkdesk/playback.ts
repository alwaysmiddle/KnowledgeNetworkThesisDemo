// HOW A WALK IS PLAYED — one definition of "what are the steps, where is the
// cursor, and what happens when it moves", shared by every surface that walks a
// walk. `WalkViewer`'s strip and the presentation frame's keyboard are two
// gestures over this one model, not two models that happen to agree.
//
// It lives beside `presented.ts` because half of the dual source below IS the
// desk: the draft is `authordraft.ts`'s singleton. Not in `src/model/`, whose
// rule is "pure and synchronous, no React"; not in `src/present/`, which would
// make a plain instrument depend on the presentation shell and invert the seam.
//
// TWO SOURCES, ONE CURSOR. A saved walk (`bus.activeWalk`, started from Trail or
// the document panel) wins when one is playing; otherwise this plays the draft
// currently open on the walk desk, live. That branch was written twice before —
// once here and once in the keyboard player — which is exactly how a strip and a
// deck end up disagreeing about which stop is stop 4.
//
// THE FOCUS WRITE IS NEW, AND IT IS A FIX. `bus.activateWalk` sets `activeWalk`
// and the walked route prefix and NOTHING ELSE — it has never written
// `bus.focus` (bus.ts: activateWalk -> setRoute, neither touches focus). So
// until now, playing a SAVED walk moved the strip and the map pins but left the
// document sitting on whatever was last clicked. A navigator that does not
// navigate is the bug; `seek` writes the focus for both sources, once.
//
// ONE CURSOR, TWO READINGS (#247, DS OB-132). `cursor` is the INTEGER stop the
// bus holds — what the strip, the document and the presenter read. `position`
// is the FRACTIONAL place the walk is while it plays: the same number while it
// rests, and between two stops while the clock carries it from one to the next.
// The map's pins and arrows and the dock's knob read `position`, because on
// those drawings the animation is not drawn on top of the position, it IS the
// position — an integer cursor lands and nothing moves.
