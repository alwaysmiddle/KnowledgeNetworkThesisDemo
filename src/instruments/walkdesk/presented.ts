// What the PRESENTATION instruments read: the walk currently open on the desk,
// resolved to one linear road (every container down to one variant, optionals
// in or out per the road's own toggle).
//
// Columns and the layer stack used to be two zones inside the Walk·Desk, fed by
// the desk's own draft. #20 split them out into instruments the Studio composes
// like any other, on the reasoning that they do a different job: they PRESENT a
// resolved road — they never see a fork, never edit, and take no drop. A preview
// belongs beside an editor, not inside it.
//
// usePresentedRoad() reads the SAME singleton draft the editor writes
// (authordraft.ts), through the same resolveRoad() the editor used to call
// locally — so what these views show is the plan actually being authored, not
// a frozen stand-in.
