// The active walk — whichever one is relevant right now — as a navigable strip.
// Two sources, one component: a SAVED walk (bus.activeWalk, played via Trail's
// walk buttons) takes priority when one is active; otherwise this shows the
// DRAFT currently open on the walk desk, live (walkdesk/presented.ts). Present
// mode mounts this instead of the walk editor, so a finished walk can be
// stepped through without the authoring UI on screen.
//
// The model behind that — steps, cursor, seek — moved to walkdesk/playback.ts
// in #195, where the presentation frame's keyboard reads the same definition.
// Seeking a SAVED walk now also moves bus.focus, which it never did before:
// activateWalk writes activeWalk and the route prefix and nothing else, so the
// document used to sit still while this strip walked.
//
// Distinct from TrailStrip, which keeps the walk TITLE / "stop N of M" text /
// deactivate control — this is purely the step-by-step navigator (WalkStrip,
// OB-071). Distinct from WalkView (id 'walk'), which is a different feature
// entirely: an ad-hoc downstream edge-follower for exploring the corpus, not a
// player for an authored walk.
