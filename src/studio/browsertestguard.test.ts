// browsertestguard.test.ts — the browser tests are still aimed at things that exist,
// and none of them has quietly fallen out of the run.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is a unit test rather than a convention. #294 turned up
// three different failures with one cause:
//
//   1. Two files in the browser-test folder held about fifty real assertions between
//      them and had not run in months, because the runner collects by FILENAME PREFIX
//      and theirs said `shot-`. Nothing anywhere noticed.
//   2. When they were finally run, a third of what they reached for had been renamed
//      or deleted underneath them — a level-button row replaced by a picker, a pane
//      rebuilt, a panel retired.
//   3. And a test that DID run every time was checking for an element by two names
//      the app has never used, so that assertion passed no matter what was on screen.
//
// The common cause is that a browser test's link to the app is a STRING, and nothing
// type-checks a string. This file does — in the unit suite, in milliseconds, with no
// browser. It cannot tell you a test still asserts the right thing; it can tell you
// the test is still talking to something that is there, which is the failure that
// actually happened and the one nobody can see by reading.
//
// It lives under src/ because that is where vitest looks (`src/**/*.test.ts`), and in
// studio/ because the registry it validates against is next door.
