// The instrument registry — what panes exist, and which combinations we ship.
//
// This replaces five hand-maintained parallel structures inside StudioView: an
// InstrumentId union, a CATALOG order array, a LABEL record, a LENS_TYPE lookup,
// and a switch that was NOT exhaustiveness-checked (add an id, forget the case,
// and you got a blank pane at runtime — it compiled fine). Deleting one flat map
// last week took nine edit sites and still left a false string in another file.
//
// Now: an instrument is one entry. Add one, and its sidebar row, its pane, its
// label and its preset eligibility all follow. InstrumentId is DERIVED from the
// array, so a preset cannot name a pane that does not exist, and reveal() cannot
// be handed a typo.
