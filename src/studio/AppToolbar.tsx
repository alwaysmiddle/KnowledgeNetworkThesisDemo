/** The application toolbar (#55): universal, app-level operations pinned directly
 *  under the app header — the DS Toolbar's designed slot. Built entirely on the
 *  DS Toolbar / ToolbarItem, glyph-only (OB-064) — the DS shipped the marks that
 *  were missing (NewMapMark/PrintMark/SaveMark/LoadMark/CopyMark/PasteMark),
 *  resolving #55's open "labels vs glyphs" call in favour of glyphs; text pills
 *  were the interim, on-spec choice while those marks didn't exist yet.
 *
 *  Only undo/redo and Present have a command model today. Undo/redo are wired to
 *  the walk-draft history in authordraft.ts (the sole undoable model in the demo
 *  — note it is WALK-scoped, not truly app-global; safe no-ops when the history
 *  is empty). new map / print / save / load / copy / cut / paste have no backing
 *  model yet, so they render disabled, carrying their `Name (Ctrl+X)` tooltip
 *  until an app-level command/clipboard model exists. See #55.
 *
 *  PRESENT (#195) is app-level in the strongest sense — it replaces the whole
 *  screen — so it belongs here rather than on any instrument. It carries no
 *  keyboard shortcut on purpose: PowerPoint's F5 is the browser's reload, which
 *  in a Vite-heavy workflow is a key the author presses constantly. Shift+F5 is
 *  the candidate if one is ever wanted.
 *
 *  THE PALETTE TOGGLE IS THE ONE ITEM HERE THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL CHROME (OB-104):
 *  the palette pane's ✕ closes it, and this is the only thing that brings it back.
 *  Ship one without the other and the pane is a one-way door. */
