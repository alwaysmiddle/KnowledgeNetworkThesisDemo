/** THE MARK'S INK OFFSET, exported because a second file needs it (OB-052): `NodeRail`'s
 *  `UP` points the same mark at a third rotation and must cancel the same offset there too
 *  — see the derivation in `caretStyle` below. One number, one home: a caller overriding the
 *  transform reads it from here rather than retyping it. A hand-typed `1` in `NodeRail`'s
 *  inline copy of this once silently reintroduced the pre-baseline drift this constant was
 *  created to remove. */

/** The disclosure mark, drawn rather than set: two 1.5px strokes meeting at a
 *  right angle, rotated −45° closed and +45° open. Font chevrons and triangles
 *  both failed here — a fill out-inks the labels, and every hollow or angle-quote
 *  glyph is too small and too oddly proportioned at 15px to read as a shape.
 *  Exported because the instrument palette (InstrumentGroup) is a containment
 *  list too and reuses this exact mark — the system draws nesting one way.
 *
 *  IF YOU REPEAT THE RECIPE, REPEAT THE LONGHANDS. This sets `borderRight` and
 *  `borderBottom` and nothing else. Writing it as `border` plus `borderTop: 'none'`
 *  looks equivalent and is not: React diffs style objects key by key, so a re-render
 *  that changes only the shorthand's colour re-sets `border` and never re-sets the two
 *  sides that were switched off — the mark fills in and the caret becomes a diamond the
 *  first time it is hovered. (DS 2026-08-17, contracted at last.)
 *
 *  THE TRANSLATE IS THE SAME IN BOTH STATES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. The mark
 *  is an L of two 1.5px strips on a 6px box, so its ink sits at an offset of (+0.964,
 *  +0.964) from the box centre. Translating by exactly the negative of that (`CARET_INK`
 *  above), IN THE ELEMENT'S OWN ROTATED FRAME, cancels it under any rotation — the ink
 *  lands on the box centre whichever way the mark points, with one number and no per-state
 *  arithmetic. It used to be `(-1, -1)` open and `(-1, +1)` closed — two hand-tuned pairs
 *  whose sign flip on y put the two states 1.465px apart vertically, so the mark visibly
 *  jumped on toggle. Do not re-tune these per state: a mark that needs to sit lower next to
 *  text wants the CALLER's inset (`CARET_FIRST_LINE_INSET` below), not the glyph's own
 *  centring. */

 *  borrowing the disc's number leaves the caret 1.46px high on a three-line chip.
 *
 *  AND DO NOT CORRECT A CENTRED CARET AT ALL. Measuring its bounding box against a
 *  line's x-height band reads 1.92px of "error" that is not there: `caretStyle`'s
 *  translate runs AFTER the rotation, so on screen it lifts the box 1.414px, and the
 *  mark's own ink centroid sits 1.364px below the box centre once rotated — the
