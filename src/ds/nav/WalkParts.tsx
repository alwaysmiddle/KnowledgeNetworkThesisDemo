 *  walk stop is not chrome: it is a mark on a line whose own vocabulary is already SIZE

 *  re-rasterizes text on every frame of a scale transition to keep it crisp. At fractional scales
 *  the glyph's baseline lands between device pixels and the rounding differs frame to frame, so
 *  the digit walks up and down by a fraction of a pixel while the disc around it moves smoothly.
 *
 *  THE FIX IS TO RASTERIZE ONCE AND SCALE THE PICTURE: `translateZ(0)` (plus the hint and the
 *  backface flag) promotes the mark to its own composited layer. The cost is honest: at 1.18 the
 *  numeral is very slightly softer at the peak of the gesture. A FACTORY, not a documented recipe,
