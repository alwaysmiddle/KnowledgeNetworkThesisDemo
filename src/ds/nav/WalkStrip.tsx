 * THE ACTIVE WALK AS A HORIZONTAL STRIP — a dedicated pane for one question: where the

 *
 * WHAT THE THREE STATES ALREADY CARRY, so this component adds nothing new for it:
 * `StepDot`'s `done` / `current` / `ahead` reads walked vs. future by ITSELF (acorn
 * wash vs. plain grey vs. the filled current dot). This component's only addition is
 * the WALKER — a mark for "the cursor is here" — and the ARROW TONE, which restates the
 * same fact along the connecting line: acorn behind the cursor, quiet bark ahead. Never
 * dashed for this — dashing means CONDITIONAL, and "not yet walked" is not that.
 *
 * THE ROW ANSWERS AS A WHOLE (`WALK_ROW_HOVER_GROW` 1.08) AND THE HOVERED STOP LOUDER
 * (`WALK_HOVER_GROW` 1.18), both from `WalkParts` — the marks growing inside their
 * fixed-width slot, so the row never reflows (OB-140).
 *
 * Typed port of the DS WalkStrip.jsx (contract: WalkStrip.d.ts); re-ported 2026-09-05
