/** A PATH THROUGH THE CORPUS, current node last and highlighted. Unlike `TrailChip`'s trail,
 *  which is temporal and append-only (everywhere you have BEEN), a breadcrumb is POSITIONAL
 *  (where you ARE): it always reflects the selected node's ancestry, so navigating replaces the
 *  whole row rather than appending to it. Ancestors are plain and clickable when `onSelect` is
 *  given; the current node draws as a filled pill and never answers a click, since clicking your
 *  own location is a no-op only a disabled-looking control would need.
 *
 *  HOVER IS INK, NOT A WASH, AND IT CARRIES THE UNDERLINE (upstream 2026-09-05). The ancestors
 *  used to be underlined at rest, which spent the loudest channel inline text has on furniture
 *  and left hover with nothing to say. Now: at rest plain `--text-2` with no rule under it;
 *  hovered or keyboard-focused, ink to `--text-1` and the underline arrives. The system's own
 *  hover recipe (`data-kn-hover` — a face one step up plus a reserved border) is deliberately
 *  NOT used here: these are 11px words in a wrapping row 6px apart, so washed boxes would touch
 *  each other and the current node's pill, and the row would read as a strip of buttons rather
 *  than as a location. Neither channel reflows, so nothing twitches under the pointer, which is
 *  the rule that recipe exists to keep.
 *
 *  Clickable ancestors are real `<button>`s, so hover has a keyboard twin — the same ink and
 *  underline on `:focus-visible`, plus the global focus ring. A control reachable only by
 *  pointer is not reachable, and hover held in React state is the only way to beat an inline
 *  style object, so the stylesheet cannot do this for us.
 *
 *  Extracted upstream 2026-08-28 from `ConnectionsSplitPane`'s private `Breadcrumb`.
 *  Typed port of the DS components/nav/Breadcrumb.jsx, OB-101 / #253. */
