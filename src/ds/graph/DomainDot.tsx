 *  same colour, a bit different. So family identity lives in hue and is pinned there; "which of

 *

 *  applies it, per region, at runtime, with nobody looking. And it has a specific failure that no

 *  REGIONS GET DIFFERENT SLOTS, AND SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HOW FAR APART THE TWO COLOURS ARE. Take
 *  the lowest free slot, as every textbook greedy does, and the assignment crowds into the low
 *  indices; on a real tessellation that measured a worst border of 0.0269 against 0.0569 for the
 *  same six colours differently distributed (DS `guidelines/nested-depth-probe.html`). So this
 *  picks the free slot FURTHEST from what its neighbours already hold, by `SLOT_DIST`, in DSATUR
 *  order (most-constrained region first).
 *
 *  EDGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT FAMILIES ARE IGNORED, deliberately: two touching regions in different
 *  families are already separated by their hue, so constraining them would spend a slot to say
 *  something the hue has already said. Pass `family` as all-one-value to constrain every edge.
 *
 *  WHAT A HOST STILL OWNS: the topology. Only the host knows which regions touch — geometrically,
 *  from its own tessellation, not from the tree (two cousins can share a border and two siblings
 *  can be nowhere near each other). And STORAGE, if the assignment is to be stable across an
 *  edit: recompute it from a changed tessellation and every colour may move. */

 *
 *  Pass the `slot` `familySlots()` gave this node. That is the whole input: WHICH OF MY NEIGHBOURS
 *  AM I NOT. Hue stays inside ±6° of the family so a descendant always reads as its ancestors'
 *  colour; lightness and chroma carry the separation.
 *
 *  DEPTH IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CHANNEL HERE ANY MORE, and that is a reversal worth reading before
 *  restoring it. The previous version graded L and C by depth (OB-086). It was measured against
 *  the app's real corpus and the finding was that depth is the wrong axis: what decides whether
 *  two regions are confusable is not how deep they are, it is WHO THEY TOUCH — and two siblings at
 *  the same depth very often share a border (`receipts/b656ebc.md`). The depth term also cost
 *  range that the neighbour axis needed, and it is redundant twice over on a map: a child sits
 *  INSIDE its parent's outline, and the host already draws an ancestor boundary ladder (thin
 *  between siblings, heavy between groups — confirmed live, 2026-08-29). A caller that wants depth
 *  legible should spend a boundary weight on it, not a lightness step.
 *
 *  Returns raw `oklch()` strings, not `var()` — a shifted hue has no token to point at; this is a
 *  computed member of the ring's family, not one of its sixteen named stops. `fill` is calibrated
 *  as a map territory; `stroke` is the same hue and slot, darkened for a territory border.
 *
 *  `index`/`of` are the OLD positional arguments and still work, mapped to `slot` by position.
 *  They are deprecated because their MEANING changed, not their name: a position among siblings is
 *  not an adjacency-safe slot, and two siblings that share a border can perfectly well be handed
 *  the same one. Move to `slot`. `depth` is accepted and ignored. */
