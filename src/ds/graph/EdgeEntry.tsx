/** THE SHAFT IS DRAWN AT THE BORDER WEIGHT OF WHAT IT CONNECTS, NEVER ABOVE IT — 1.25,
 *  against the 1px border of the `NodeChip mark="border-2"` ends this component renders.
 *  The nodes are the objects; a line between them is a statement ABOUT them, so it does not
 *  get to be the heaviest mark in the row. The chip form at the ends is what fixes the
 *  number: `mark="border"` is a `--stroke-rule` border and takes the sequence arrow's 1.5
 *  (`NodeArrow.SHAFT_STROKE`); `border-2` is 1px and takes this.
 *
 *  MATCHING THE NUMBER IS NOT MATCHING THE MARK, which is why this is 1.25 and not a flat 1:
 *  a 1px CSS border takes the browser's own rounding while a 1px `crispEdges` rect snaps to
 *  the device grid, and at dpr 1.5 the available steps are about 0.67 / 1.33 / 2.0 css px. A
 *  flat 1 drops the shaft a step BELOW the border it should match — it reads as a divider,
 *  and it fades `depends_on`, the quietest of the four hues, out from under
 *  `implemented_with`.
 *
 *  IT WAS 3px HERE UNTIL THIS PORT — triple the border at its ends and off the stroke ladder
 *  entirely (`--stroke-hair` 1 · `--stroke-rule` 1.5 · `--stroke-node` 2). Run length does
 *  not set the weight; it sets how badly a mismatch reads, and over a 110px column that is
 *  eight times the ink of the same error in a 14px gap. It survived because it was only ever
 *  judged in bulk: down a list of five, shafts calibrate each other and read as a column of
 *  rules. It took a pane holding a SINGLE relation to see it.
 *
 *  DERIVED, not typed: `shaftFor('border-2')` is the rule applied to the form this component
 *  renders at both ends, so the chip form and the shaft cannot drift apart. Still exported,
 *  because it was retyped once already and a port needs something to import. */

   than an object: 1px of domain hue, transparent face, no lift, caption type at --text-2,
   --radius-md, centred. Until this port THIS FILE DREW THEM ITSELF, which was one recipe in
   two places and the reason the form was promoted to a chip mark at all. All that is left
   here is the EMPHASIS, which is entry-specific and belongs to the SENTENCE rather than to
   the chip — which is also why `NodeChip.title` widened to a ReactNode. */
/* A path deeper than one step is ELIDED, not wrapped: the node column is a third of
   a pane at best, and "Networking / Protocol Stack / TCP & UDP" set inline there hits
   break-word and comes apart mid-word — five stacked fragments in a pill five times
   the height of the connector beside it. The segment that earns its place is the
   FIRST: it is the focus node, the same bold name every row in the list opens on. The
   middle is what the reader already knows from having navigated there, so it goes to
   an ellipsis, and the whole path stays in the tooltip. */

     set beside it at ordinary weight. So every entry in a list opens on the same bold
     name — the one at the head of the rail — and the eye reads down the column instead
     of re-parsing each row.

     THE DIRECT CASE IS `NodeChip focus`, NOT A STYLED TITLE. It used to pass a
     pre-styled span with --fw-bold/--text-1 written in — the same statement `focus` now
     makes on the chip's own behalf, so there is one implementation of "this is the
     subject of the pane" instead of two agreeing by coincidence.

     THE `within` CASE KEEPS ITS OWN MARKUP. Its emphasis falls on PART of the string —
     the ancestry prefix, not the child name after it — and `focus` is a statement about
     a whole chip; bolding the entire title there would erase the distinction the
     elision exists to draw. */
