 *
 *  `rung` is where the stub crosses to the chip, measured from the top of the stop, and
 *  it is deliberately NOT recomputed for a wrapped chip — the rung meets the chip's FIRST
 *  line, which is the line the name starts on at any length. `spineLeft` is shared by the
 *  head's own leader stub, which is why the two line up without either knowing about the
 *  other.
 *
 *  Port of DS components/graph/NodeRail.jsx. THIS PORT HAS NO HOST YET: the Connections
 *  pane (src/studio/instruments.tsx) has no railroad form — that is the remaining half of
 *  #97 — so NodeRail stays un-rendered until it lands (tracked in src/ds/barrel.test.ts,
