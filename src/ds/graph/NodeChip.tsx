 *  when adding one:
 *
 *    1. WHAT THE CHIP IS — `mark`, which of the sanctioned carriers holds the domain
 *       hue and at which rank. The SURFACE picks it. Plus the states `lit`, `dim`,
 *       `optional`, `open` and `wrap`, which say how this chip stands right now — each
 *       one works on every form, which is what makes it a state.
 *    2. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IT — `selectable` (a click), `resizable` (an edge drag),
 *       `onDelete` (a ✕). ALL THREE ARE OPT-IN, ALL THREE DEFAULT OFF, and ALL THREE
 *       WORK ON EVERY `mark` FORM. `<NodeChip title domain />` is the static chip.
 *
 *  So a capability is never a property of a form: there is no resizable form and no
 *  clickable form, and tying one to `mark` — or giving one a form-dependent default —
 *  makes two components out of one. If a chip should not be sized in a dense list,

   *  from the DS 2026-08-19, which kept the dashed border and ADDED the word.
   *
   *  It says two things at once, on purpose. The border DASHES, which is what dashed already
   *  means everywhere in this system (`NodeArrow dashed`, the group's empty-version zone):
   *  conditional, not yet, may not happen. And the chip says the WORD, because a dash is a

   *  the line's style is the only one left. Do NOT reach for `--state-optional` — it is a
   *  shade of acorn, and acorn means ON THE AUTHORED WALK, so an optional step painted with
   *  it says the opposite of what it is.

   *  THE WORD IS FIXED AT "(optional)" AND THERE IS NO PROP TO REWORD IT. One condition, one

   *  instead of drawn.

   *  --radius-md — which makes it ONE --fs-micro LINE TALLER than the same chip without it,

/* ═══ PUBLISHED GEOMETRY ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  How wide and how tall is this chip, before it renders?
 *
 *  The same question GroupGeometry answers for the card, asked for the same
 *  reason: a board that lays out arithmetically — AuthorRoad does, and must,
 *  since its arrows, its drop bands and its own extent all need every box
 *  placed before React commits anything — cannot ask a rendered chip how big
 *  it is. So it either guesses or it is told. It guessed: `CHAR_W = 8` for a
 *  proportional face and `LEAF_CHROME_W = 40` for chrome that is really ~83,
 *  so a title scored as one line wrapped to two and was clipped against the
 *  height it had been told.
 *
 *  This table was originally kept in this file because the DS shipped no geometry for
 *  this component (reported on drift-log #74). As of 2026-08-21 it published its own —
 *  `NodeChip.d.ts`'s own PUBLISHED GEOMETRY section — and this port now takes that
 *  contract whole (OB-048): `usedStroke()` for the border edge, no width floor unless
 *  the caller asks for one (`spec.minWidth` defaults to none, not `CHIP_METRICS.minWidth`
 *  — that number is the RESIZE DRAG's floor, not a layout floor), and a height that is
 *  rounded to 2dp rather than ceiled, since a board STACKS on it and a ceiled height puts
 *  a pixel of slack under every chip in a column. Two rules are what make what IS here
 *  hold:
 *
 *  1. CSS OWNS WHAT CSS DECLARES. The stroke, the line height, the font sizes
 *     and the weights are read from the stylesheet at measure time — the very
 *     custom properties the style block below writes — so a token change lands
 *     in the drawing and in the prediction together or not at all.
 *  2. THE TABLE OWNS WHAT JS DECLARES. Every number written as a literal in
 *     that style block lives in CHIP_METRICS and is read back from there, so
 *     the same is true of a padding, a gap or the delete button's box.
 *
 *  Text is MEASURED, not estimated: an offscreen canvas at the chip's own font.
 *  It needs no layout and no paint, so it is legal in the same pass that
 *  computes positions. Without a document (SSR, tests) it falls back to a
 *  0.55em factor and says so via `measured: false`.
 *
 *  `fontOf` / `measure` / `linesOf` are this file's own copies of the group's,
 *  not a shared import — the same call the DS makes for useRecede and
 *  useSizeDrag, and for the same reason: each component stays re-portable on
 *  its own, and a re-sync of one never has to reason about the other.
 *

 *  forms and fails on any disagreement between chipSize and the rendered box. */

           on 2026-08-19 and handed back as OB-035 — so the line is unchanged and it
           is no longer a deviation. What follows is why it is the rule, kept because
           both alternatives are what a flex row reaches for first.

           The two spans have DIFFERENT LINE BOXES: the index at --fs-micro 11 x
           --lh-snug is 14.85, the title at --fs-body 13 x --lh-snug is 17.55. No top-
           or centre-alignment makes two unequal boxes share a line. Measured against
           the title's FIRST line, which is the line the number belongs on at any
           length: `flex-start` is a constant -3px, `center` is -2.14 at one line and
           DRIFTS with the block (+6.63 at two, +15.41 at three), `baseline` is 0.00 at
           one, two and three lines.

           AND A TOLD HEIGHT GETS NO BRANCH OF ITS OWN. The first upstream fix read
           `size && size.h ? 'center' : (stacked ? 'baseline' : 'center')`, which put
           the drift straight back for any caller that sets a height — and that is
           every caller here. A BOARD THAT LAYS ITSELF OUT ARITHMETICALLY TELLS EVERY
           LEAF ITS HEIGHT: `AuthorRoad` asks `chipSize()` and hands back `{w, h}` for
           every stop, so the told path is the ONLY path on our road, and the branch
           upstream treated as the exception is our rule. Told column, measured by
           shot-foldab: -2.64 / +6.13 / +14.91 at one, two and three lines — the same
           drift their own rig had already disqualified `center` for. Their specimens
           all size themselves, which is why none of them showed it.

           A told height still centres a chip that is NOT stacked, and that is right:
           one line in a hand-set box has real slack, and text pinned to its top reads
           as a layout accident. Safe here because the X carries its own alignSelf and
           `mark="border"` has no dot — a dot-form chip would need its marginTop
           revisited, which is the DS's call. */

           `max-width: 100%`, so a chip whose longest word is wider than its share of a row
           spilled straight out of its container (the DS's connections pane, owner-reported
