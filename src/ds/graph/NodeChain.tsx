  /* THE CHAIN TELLS EACH ARROW WHAT IT JOINS, so the connector-weight rule is not something
     anyone has to remember here. A connector is drawn at the border weight of what it
     connects and never above it; the chain places both chips, so it can read the `mark` off
     them — the same look at a child's props it already does for `index` — and settle the
     weight itself. An explicit `arrowProps.joins` wins: a caller who knows better than the
     inference is rare but real (a chain of wrappers around chips).
     TWO SIGNALS, IN ORDER OF HOW SPECIFIC THEY ARE. `props.mark` is the exact form this child
     renders, so it wins. `type.joinBorder` is the component's own declaration of what its
     edge weighs, which is how a child that is NOT one of our chips answers at all — a
     `VersionedGroup` card, or anything else that declares one. A chip with no explicit `mark`
     has no useful prop and falls through to `NodeChip.joinBorder` for the default form's
     weight. Neither present: undefined, and the arrow keeps its own default. */

  /* ONE WEIGHT FOR THE WHOLE CHAIN — the LIGHTEST member's edge, not each gap's own pair.
     The arrows are the chain's fixed scaffolding (they do not travel with a dragged node),
     so they read as one line interrupted by nodes; a mixed column computed per gap gives
     1.5 · 1.25 · 1.5 down a single axis, which reads as a rendering fault rather than as
     three considered weights. The same reason the chain owns one arrow LENGTH. Lightest,
     because "never above what it connects" has to hold for every arrow in the column, and
     only the lightest member satisfies all of them at once.
     NOT AN AVERAGE — the obvious improvement, and wrong three times over. (1) A mean matches
     nothing on screen: 1px and two 2px members give ~1.7, and there is no 1.7 border in the
     picture, so the line stops matching anything the eye can check. (2) Too light is a small
     harm and too heavy is the fault being avoided — with the minimum, arrows beside the
     heavier members are thinner than they could be and still read as connectors; with a mean
     the two arrows touching the LIGHT member outweigh it, which is the original defect
     localised to one gap. (3) A mean is unstable under editing, and this chain is editable:
     delete one node and every arrow's weight changes with no cause a user can see, where the
     minimum only moves when the lightest member itself leaves. */
