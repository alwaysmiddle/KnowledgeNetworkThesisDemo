/* ═══ PUBLISHED GEOMETRY ════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  How tall is this card, before it renders?
 *
 *  A board that lays its cards out arithmetically — AuthorRoad does, and must:
 *  it places every box in one pass before React commits anything — cannot ask a
 *  rendered group how big it is. So it either guesses or it is told. It guessed:
 *  `CHAR_W = 8`, `HEAD_LINE_H = 17.55`, `FOLD_CHROME = 44.85`, the last two
 *  read off SCREENSHOTS of this component. Numbers obtained that way are correct
 *  exactly once. Every padding change here silently misplaced their cards, and
 *  nothing on either side reported it.
 *
 *  These functions are the same numbers, exported from the file that draws them.
 *  The paddings below are not a copy of the component's — they are read by the
 *  component too (GROUP_METRICS), so a change lands in the drawing and in the
 *  prediction together or not at all.
 *
 *  Text is MEASURED, not estimated: an offscreen canvas at the same font
 *  shorthand the label uses. It needs no layout and no paint, so it is legal in
 *  the same pass that computes positions — which is what makes a monospace
 *  `CHAR_W` for a proportional display face unnecessary rather than merely
 *  wrong. Without a document (SSR, tests) it falls back to a 0.55em factor and
 *  says so via `measured: false`.
 *
 *  LOCAL CORRECTIONS (marked ★ below, reported on drift-log #74): the DS's
 *  functions as shipped on 2026-08-16 predict a few px short of what the DS
 *  component itself renders — the picker floors at 30 (padding + borders + its
 *  18px cells), not 28; and the narrow tally row is 18.84, not 14.85. Two more
 *  corrections that used to be listed here are GONE, fixed at the source rather
 *  than patched: the card's two side edges are now asked of the display by
 *  `hairline()` in the layout pass (OB-024, no `faceBorder` constant survives
 *  it), and the description row carries its own font-size and line-height, so
 *  its line box is exactly `lines × descLine` with no strut to compensate for
 *  (OB-028). Measured by tools/studio-spike/shot-foldab.mjs
 *  ("headRows() calibration" / bodySlot cases), which also checks these
 *  functions against the rendered card so a drift shows up as a number. */

  /* THE DESCRIPTION IS THE ONE ROW SET TIGHTER THAN --lh-snug, and it carries the head's
     only two negative numbers. The head is a 4px-gap column; this row absorbs that gap on
     BOTH sides — `descPullUp` takes all 4 above, `descPullUnder` 2 of the 4 below — and
     drops to --lh-tight with no padding of its own. A description is one line under the
     name it describes, so the space around it is distance from its subject rather than
     readability. Empty, that space was the whole problem: 22.2px of reserved void between
     the title and the picker, as tall as the title row itself. The row now contributes
     11.8px whether it is filled or empty, so nothing moves on hover and a board can still
     predict a card it has not pointed at.
     `descLine` is this row's ONLY line metric, and three older names went out with it —
     the snug caption line it replaces, and the two struts that used to patch the row at
     one line and at the last wrapped one. Those two were a COMPENSATION, not a
     measurement: the row took the card's 13px strut, so its line box was 17.55 round a
     12px line and the patch made up the difference. Giving the row its own font-size and
     line-height removes the defect they patched, so the row is exactly `lines × descLine`
     with nothing to make up — and a port that carried the patch forward anyway would
     double-count it. A line box is set by the containing block's font, not by the inline
     that happens to sit in it. Do not reintroduce a second line metric here. */
