 *
 *  THE TEXTBOX WASH IS ON THE FIELD, NOT ON THE PILL. `--state-editing-wash` lights the typing
 *  area alone, and only while it is active: the pill holds two BUTTONS as well as the field, and
 *  washing the whole of it tinted the controls with it and read as one big lit-up bar (owner,

 *
 *  THE ARROW IS ABSENT UNTIL THERE IS SOMETHING TO SAVE, and grey when it arrives: acorn only
 *  under the pointer, so the colour is a response rather than a decoration (owner, v15 → v18).
 *  It is `EnterMark` — the return key, the same mark every other Enter in the presenter parts
 *  draws. ⏎ saves too, and nothing in the box says so: the room is worth more than the reminder.

 *  the whole problem to the host, which meant nothing happened at the desk (owner, 2026-09-03:
 *  "new category in the dropdown dont work"). Now the row becomes a field: the system offers the
 *  next unspent glyph from `NOTE_CATEGORY_POOL`, THE SWATCH OPENS THE REST OF THE POOL so the
 *  professor can pick a different one (owner, same day — placeholders until the real set is
 *  drawn), they type a name, and `onAddCategory` receives a WHOLE `NoteCategory` to append. The
 *  wash still travels with the glyph rather than being a second choice: two decisions where one
 *  will do is how a category ends up unreadable. */

 * THE DURING COLUMN IS THIS STOP'S NOTES (owner, 2026-09-03). Both columns answer the same
 * question — what belongs to the stop in front of the class — so the pane is never half
 * stop-scoped and half lecture-scoped. With `stop` the pane filters the whole lecture's list to
 * the shown stop itself and stamps a save with it; the whole lecture's list is the recap's
