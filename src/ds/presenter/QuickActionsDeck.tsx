     wins":
       1. tile height, 42 down to `tileMin` 28, headings and rule intact;
       2. the ROW GAP, 8 down to `gapMin` 4 — the cheapest 12px on the pane, and it is bought
          before any WORDS are given up; the column gap never moves;
       3. the group LABELS — the tiles still say what they are, a heading only says where a group
          starts;
       4. the tiles again, `tileMin` 28 down to `tileFloor` 22, the smallest row this system will
          draw as pressable;
       5. the RULE, replaced by `groupGap`, which is the last thing that still separates them;
       6. the scroller. The net, not the norm.
     THE RULE OUTLIVES THE LABELS ON PURPOSE — a label costs 21 a group, the rule 18 for the pair,
     so the cheaper mark is also the one that survives longer. And the ladder ONLY CLIMBS DOWN
