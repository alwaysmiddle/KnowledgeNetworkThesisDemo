/** THE PANE'S FRAME, handed down rather than found. `Pane` puts a ref to its frame
 *  in here, so this header knows which element to watch for the pointer WITHOUT
 *  walking the DOM. It used to reach `parentElement`, which made "PaneHeader must
 *  be a direct child of the frame" a rule a caller could break silently — a wrapper
 *  div between the two scoped the reveal to the header strip, so the close control
 *  simply never appeared and nothing said why. With the context there is no rule
 *  left: nest it as deep as you like inside a `Pane`. The `parentElement` walk
 *  survives as the fallback for a pane composed BY HAND, where it is still the right
 *  answer and still needs the header to be a direct child. */

/** Every instrument pane wears the same hat: just its title, sitting ON the
 *  pane's own hairline border like a legend — the border is the frame and the
 *  title is part of it. A pane carries NO subtitle or description line.
 *  `variant="bar"` is the older filled title row.
 *
 *  The ✕ keeps the scrollbar's manners: absent while the pane is at rest,
 *  present the moment the pointer (or the keyboard) is inside it, so a dormant
 *  pane wears an unbroken border rather than a hole where a control used to be.
 *  WHAT THE PANE AROUND IT MUST DO — three rules this header's geometry depends on
 *  that no prop can express. PREFER `Pane`, which owns the frame and the body and
 *  makes all three unstateable-wrong; these apply when something composes a frame
 *  by hand. They lived only in the DS readme until 2026-08-17, where a port could
 *  not see them, and all three were missed here:
 *
 *   1. `position: relative`, the `--border-frame` hairline on the pane itself, and
 *      `--radius-lg` (20px) corners. The legend masks the border with a straight 2px
 *      bar, which cannot erase a curve — a tighter radius leaves a stub beside the ✕.
 *      This rule is NOT satisfied by clipping: a frame that is correctly `visible`
 *      with an `overflow: hidden` + radius div immediately inside it has all of the
 *      cost and none of the rule — it re-traps the ✕'s notch and any menu a body
 *      opens, and it bites the scroller's gutter with the corner arc. Delete the
 *      body's background; do not add a clip. The only pane that legitimately clips
 *      is one whose CONTENT must be cropped (`PaneCanvas`), and it rounds all four
 *      corners at `--radius-lg`, never the bottom two alone.
 *   2. THE BODY TAKES NO BACKGROUND OF ITS OWN; the pane's `--surface-paper` shows
 *      through. This header is 11px tall, so a body that paints its own colour starts
 *      INSIDE the 20px corner arc with square corners and bites two square notches out
 *      of the pane's rounded top — worst when that colour is `--surface-canopy`, which
 *      reads as a hole in the sheet.
 *   3. A SCROLLING BODY INSETS ITSELF `SCROLLER_INSET` FROM THE TOP **AND** THE BOTTOM
 *      (`marginTop` and `marginBottom`, not a radius on the scroller), so the
 *      scrollbar's end arrow stays clear of the corner arc at EITHER end instead of
 *      being clipped by it or painting out over it; the pane's own paper fills both
 *      strips. One inset serves both axes and both ends — a scroller reserves an
 *      arrow square at each end of its gutter, and a pane has a rounded corner at
 *      each end of its right edge. Better still, take `PaneScroller`, which applies
 *      both automatically.
 *
 *  A GRABBABLE TITLE WEARS A `Grip`, because a cursor is feedback and not an
 *  affordance: it arrives only once you are already hovering the exact strip, so a
 *  draggable pane and a fixed one otherwise look identical at rest. Four dots in a
 *  square, AFTER the title, inside the same span that carries the grab — so the
 *  mark sits in the hit area it advertises rather than beside it. One flat
 *  `--bark-400`, no hover step: the cursor already answers the hover, and a mark
 *  that also darkens is asking to be noticed twice.
 *
 *  Typed port of the DS PaneHeader.jsx (contract: PaneHeader.d.ts). */
