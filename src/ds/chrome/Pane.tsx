 *  cannot repeat its radius: the child sits some distance in, and at that depth the
 *  parent's arc has already turned, so an equal radius curves away from the parent's now
 *  straight edge and leaves a crescent of the parent showing. A canvas 12px below a 20px
 *  frame with a 20px top radius shows two of them, and `--sink-1`'s 1px inner ring traces
 *  the lot — which reads as a grey outline floating inside the body.
 *
 *  So each corner takes `frame radius − this corner's inset`, floored at 0, read off the
 *  live frame rather than hard-coded. Measuring is what keeps the number out of here: a
 *  `variant="bar"` header is 34px, past the 20px arc, and the top corners then compute to
 *  square all by themselves — which is correct, and is not a case anyone would have
 *  remembered to write down. `useLayoutEffect` runs before paint, so nothing flashes.
 *
 *  THE FRAME IS FOUND THROUGH THE DOM, NOT THROUGH `PaneFrameContext`, and that is not a
 *  style choice. React attaches a parent host element's ref while walking the commit
 *  bottom-up, AFTER its children's layout effects have run — so on first mount
 *  `frameRef.current` is still null here, the measurement bails, and with no dependency
 *  that can change it never runs again. Mutations are committed before layout effects, so
 *  the DOM is reliable when a ref is not: `closest('[data-pane-frame]')`, then the nearest
