 *  MOVES between the click and the caret — a property of editing in place, not luck.
 *  A field would have re-laid the text out first, which is why this could not have
 *  been done with one.
 *
 *  `caretRangeFromPoint` is the Chrome spelling and `caretPositionFromPoint` the

 *  trailing space) the caret goes to the END, never back to select-all. */

/** THE FIELD, NOT JUST THE EDGE. An outline in `--state-editing` (never a border — it
 *  paints outside the box without joining the layout, so the edge cannot move the row
 *  and has no used border width to cancel) plus a full wash behind the text: an outline
 *  alone read as "this line happens to have a border" rather than "this is a textbox"
 *  — owner-reported 2026-08-28. The wash is pond's own 50 (`--state-editing-wash`), one
 *  step lighter than the outline's own vivid step, so the two read as one family. (Until
 *  OB-110 this port kept the background transparent — the pre-2026-08-28 recipe.)
 *
 *  BLUE, ONE STEP BRIGHTER THAN SELECTION. `--state-editing` is `--pond-vivid` —
 *  pond already means "the thing I am acting on", and the vivid step exists for
 *  this one edge, because a transient outline has to be found at a glance where a
 *  selection wash is read past. A named token rather than a reach into
 *  `--state-selected`, whose name would then be lying on a line being typed into.
 *  What keeps the two apart on screen is the step and the object: selection
 *  outlines a chip or a card at 2px, this outlines a run of TEXT at 1px.
 *
 *  THE ROOM AT THE ENDS IS ASYMMETRIC, because the row is. The head leaves exactly
 *  4px between the index's last glyph and the title's first, so the whole left
 *  inset has to fit inside it — the outline's own 3px offset is that inset, 1px
 *  clear of the number, and there is no left padding at all. The right end takes
 *  4px of padding handed straight back as an equal negative margin, so the wrap
 *  width and the row's height are untouched. Widening the head's index gap to
 *  balance the two ends is refused: that gap is published geometry
 *  (`titleColumn`, and the description's indent reads the same expression), so a
 *  transient editing state would be reshaping the resting card for every caller.
 *
 *  AND THE ROOM IS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE WRAP WIDTH, NOT OUT OF IT. `base.css` puts
 *  everything in `border-box` and all three of the card's lines are capped at
 *  `maxWidth: 100%`, so in border-box that 4px comes off the width the TEXT wraps
 *  in: a name ending within 4px of the wrap point gained a line on the click that
 *  opened it — and where the clamp already allowed two lines the card's height did
 *  not change at all, so nothing reported it. `content-box` makes `maxWidth: 100%`
 *  mean the text's 100% again. The rule: an in-place editor may not change the box
 *  the text wraps in, and `box-sizing` is part of that box.
 *
 *  AND NOT THE FOCUS RING. `base.css` rings every `:focus-visible` element with
 *  `--ring-focus` at a `--radius-sm` corner, and Chrome counts an editable element
 *  as focus-visible even when a CLICK opened it — so an open line wore a second
 *  edge from a global rule rather than from this file. `boxShadow: 'none'`, one
 *  edge, declared in one place. `minHeight: '1lh'` so an emptied line still holds a
 *  caret; `maxHeight`/`overflow` release any display clamp so a value longer than its
 *  rest-state cap is legible while it is being typed — a display compromise has no
 *  business hiding characters from the person typing them.
 *
 *  Read the values, do not spread the object — implement the recipe on your own
 *  editable element if you are not using `InlineText` directly. */
