 *  and one set of manners everywhere, in two TONES — chrome for a neutral act
 *  (close a pane, dismiss a menu), danger for a destructive one (delete a node,
 *  delete a version).
 *
 *  THE BORDER IS RESERVED AT REST. 1px transparent, always, with
 *  `boxSizing: 'border-box'`, so hovering paints the border IN rather than adding
 *  it — a border that appears on hover moves the glyph a pixel and the control
 *  twitches under the pointer. This is the single most-repeated mistake when the
 *  recipe is hand-written, and it is why this is a component and not prose.
 *
 *  DESTRUCTIVE IS BERRY AT REST. `tone="danger"` inks `--state-danger` before
 *  anyone touches it and hovers within its OWN ramp. Never neutral-until-berry:
 *  hover in this system is a one-step wash of an element's own family and never a
 *  hue change, and a warning that arrives on hover arrives too late.
 *
 *  `reveal={false}` is the recede: the control keeps its space (so nothing
 *  reflows when it arrives) but is invisible, untabbable and inert. Every
 *  hover-revealed control in the system uses this rather than unmounting.
 *
 *  Typed port of the DS IconButton.jsx (contract: IconButton.d.ts). Replaces the

 *
 *  IT IS A HOOK RATHER THAN AN UNCONDITIONAL `title=`, and that is the whole design.
 *  A tooltip repeating a line you can already read in full fires on every hover of
 *  every row on a board, and noise at that scale trains people straight past the one

 *
 *  MEASURED ON POINTER ENTRY, not at render. Whether a line clips is a fact about
 *  its laid-out width, and that changes with the pane, the sidebar, a window resize
 *  and the string itself — a value computed at render is stale by the time anyone
 *  hovers it. The cost is one measurement per hover, of an element already under the
 *  pointer.
 *
 *  BOTH AXES, because the system clips both ways: `scrollWidth` for a one-line
 *  `text-overflow` clip, `scrollHeight` for a clamped block. The 1px tolerance is for

 *  replacing it with a drawn one would mean a popover that has to escape every
 *  stacking context in the app (the version menu already needs a portal for exactly
 *  that) plus its own show delay, hover grace, edge flipping and focus behaviour — a
 *  component's worth of surface for a line of text. Newlines, though, a native tooltip
 *  does honour. So the string is folded on word boundaries at about 44 characters, the
 *  same measure a paragraph of prose wants and well inside every platform's cap.
 *
 *  ANYTHING ALREADY SHORTER COMES BACK UNTOUCHED. That is what lets this be applied at
 *  every `title=` in the system with no judgement left at the call site about whether a
 *  particular label is "long enough to bother" — the one exception the DS allowed
 *  lasted an hour before producing the exact defect it was excusing.
 *
 *  AND AN UNBROKEN RUN LONGER THAN THE MEASURE IS BROKEN ANYWAY. The first version left
 *  a long word whole, reasoning that a break inside a word misreports the string; one
 *  60-character run then drew the screen-wide line this function exists to prevent, so
 *  the exception swallowed the rule. The reasoning was wrong as well as costly — the
 *  tooltip shows the same characters either way, only the line breaks are added, and a
 *  NAME is exactly where such a run turns up (a pasted id, a typo, a URL). Word
 *  boundaries are still preferred; a run with none is cut into measure-sized pieces.
 *
 *  AN ABSENT OR EMPTY STRING COMES BACK AS `undefined`, NEVER AS `''` (OB-047). An empty
 *  `title` attribute is not the same as no title at all — it also suppresses any
 *  ANCESTOR's tooltip — so `title={wrapTip(x)}` is correct for every `x`, missing ones
 *  included, and no call site has to guard it with its own `|| undefined`. A caller that
