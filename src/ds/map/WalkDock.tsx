 *  is a comet rail: every stop a 2px tick whose ink and height carry the recency band, the
 *  position one round knob riding the FRACTIONAL position, the current stop's name and a readout
 *  in the row above. OPEN, the chevron grows the rail upward into a row of named `StepDot`s with
 *  the walker on the current one — the same line runs on through the dots, so the two sizes read
 *  as one rail at two scales, not two controls. The transport row stays on top in both.
 *
 *  WHY AN OVERLAY: expanding must not move the map. The dock is absolutely positioned inside the
 *  pane's clip, over the map, on a paper wash; the SVG never changes size, and the pins under the
 *  open dock show through. The host insets its auto-fit by `WALK_DOCK_METRICS.closed` so at rest
 *  no pin sits under the strip (owner, 2026-09-01); open covers 50px of map and that is the
 *  trade for a collapsed state that costs nothing.
 *
 *  WHY TICKS, NOT DOTS, WHEN CLOSED: sixty dots across a 520px rail sit 8.8px apart, so an 11px
 *  dot overlaps both neighbours and the trail becomes one blob. A tick carries the band in ink
 *  and height — the map's own vocabulary at a scale where a dot cannot go.
 *
 *  THE HOST OWNS THE POSITION, as `WalkStrip` and `NodeRail` own nothing of theirs: `onSeek`
 *  reports an integer stop, `onPlayToggle` asks the host to run its clock; the dock holds no
 *  timer. `position` accepts the host's integer cursor unchanged — the knob then steps; a
