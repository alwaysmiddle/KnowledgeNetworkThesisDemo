     last survives — a person clicks one caret per render and never sees it, a driver does.
     Found by our own `4b637d1` run and adopted upstream as a contract change rather than a
     footnote, which is why the NAME changed with the meaning instead of the same prop
     quietly starting to mean something else.

     `onOpenChange` keeps the old resolved shape AND the old fault, deprecated. The tree only
     ever calls `setOpen` with a function; the non-function branch exists so the published
     signature stays honest rather than throwing at a caller the type would have allowed. */
