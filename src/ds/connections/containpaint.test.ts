// containpaint.test.ts — every contains pill draws its OWN node's topic colour (DS OB-174).
//
// WHY THIS IS A UNIT TEST AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. The reported fault was visible — "the
// connections pane's contains tree node pill border colours are all the same colour" — but the
// RULE underneath it is arithmetic over a tree, and arithmetic is exactly what a look cannot
// check. A screenshot can tell you the column is no longer monochrome; it cannot tell you that
// the third pill took slot 2 because the two above it share its hue, nor that a pill whose hue
// changed went back to slot 0 rather than continuing someone else's ladder. Those are the
// clauses, so they are pinned here, and the LOOK is checked in the browser driver beside them.
//
// The one rule worth restating, because it is the reason this function may exist at all: a tree
// stacks its pills in ONE COLUMN, so the only pill that touches a given pill is the one drawn
// immediately before it in visible order. That makes "step one slot down the family ladder per
// same-hue pill" a complete answer here. A MAP cannot reason this way — there, which regions
// touch is geometry, and the host has to call `familySlots()` with its own adjacency.
