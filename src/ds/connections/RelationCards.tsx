/** THE ROW'S GEOMETRY, published. One derivation covers all three boxes in a row — two pills and
 *  the arrow — so the arrow keeps exactly what the pills leave and the row can never need to
 *  scroll to reveal its own edge.
 *
 *  `cardMax` IS THE ANSWER TO A WIDE PANE, and the reason it exists is that the derivation below
 *  hands the connector whatever the pills leave: with the pills capped, every pixel of a widening
 *  went into SHAFT, and at a 980px pane the row drew two 168px pills either side of 621px of
 *  hairline (owner, 2026-08-28). A relationship is a SENTENCE, and the distance between its
 *  subject and its object carries nothing — past a point it only makes the eye travel. So the
 *  CARD stops growing at 620 and the surplus stays OUTSIDE it, as pane margin: a widened pane is
 *  for the graph and the tree, which do use the room. The cap is applied as a `maxWidth` on the
 *  MEASURED container, so `rowsW` is already the capped width and one derivation still covers
 *  every box — there is no second, uncapped path.
 *
 *  `pillMax` 200 (168 before the cap, 108 in the first cut): at 620 the surplus goes to the
 *  PILLS, where the reading happens, not to the connector. The connector needs no cap of its own
 *  — `cardMax` bounds it at about 197 — and A NUMBER THAT IS DERIVED MUST NOT ALSO BE DECLARED.
 *
 *  `groupChrome` is what a grouped card spends that a flat row does not: the 1px source bracket
 *  plus its margins, the 1px TARGET spine that collects a stack of arrows into a shared pill, a
 *  third gap, and 4px of source hover-wash padding. Leave it out of the budget and the target
 *  pill overhangs the pane with its right border clipped by the scroller. It is deducted from
 *  EVERY grouped row, single-target rows that draw no spine included: 2px of pill width is the
 *  price of one budget instead of two. `safety` is spent ONCE, inside the pill derivation;
 *  deducting it again when measuring the arrow's label truncates two characters early.
 *
 *  `blockGap` and `arrowStacked` are ONE DECISION IN TWO NUMBERS, and the RATIO is the point: a
 *  stack of arrows is read as belonging to its pill by PROXIMITY, so the distance between two
 *  arrows inside a block (26) must stay clearly under the distance between two blocks (13 plus
 *  the arrows' own box). Both are CHOSEN, not derived — at the shipped 4/30 the two spacings were
 *  near enough equal that the top two arrows read as floating between their pill and the one
 *  below (owner, 2026-08-28). Move them as a pair or the grouping goes. */
