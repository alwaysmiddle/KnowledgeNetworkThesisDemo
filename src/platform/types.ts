// WHAT THE HOST CAN DO — the one interface between this app and whatever is
// running it. Today that is a browser tab; the shipping host will be an Electron
// window (#201), and the browser build becomes a port target.
//
// The seam exists because those two hosts answer the same questions differently,
// NOT because one of them is "the real one". A common misreading is that wrapping
// the app in Electron gives the app Node: it does not. Electron's renderer is a
// Chromium page like any other and never has Node — Node lives in the MAIN
// process, reached over IPC through a preload script. So there is no version of
// this app that "uses Node directly". There is only: the app asks for a
// capability, and something answers.
//
// This interface is that question. `web.ts` answers it with browser APIs; a
// desktop preload would answer it with IPC calls. Callers see neither.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// CAPABILITY-SHAPED, NEVER HOST-SHAPED (#211). The rule every method here obeys,
// and the reason the interface is worth having at all.
//
//   ASK WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE. NEVER ASK WHAT IS RUNNING THIS.
//
// A method is well shaped when EVERY host can answer it — some better than
// others. The weak answer is a real answer: an empty array, a `false`, a promise
// that resolves having done nothing. Never a throw, never `undefined`. A weak
// answer must degrade the feature, never break it: `screens()` returning `[]`
// means "present where the window already is", which is exactly what ships
// today.
//
// The alternative — a boolean per host, and callers branching on it — throws
// away capability in both directions. #204 was filed believing only a desktop
// host could put a deck on a chosen display; Chromium does it with
// `getScreenDetails()` + `requestFullscreen({ screen })`, so `if (name ===
// 'electron')` would have killed the feature in every browser AND until the
// wrapper shipped, for nothing. And in the other direction it is the one line
// that makes the later web port impossible.
//
// Operationally: WEB API FIRST, IPC ONLY WHERE CHROMIUM HAS NO ANSWER. A
// web-standard implementation runs in the desktop host (its renderer IS
// Chromium) and is the web port, already written.
//
// KEEP IT SMALL. Every method here is a promise to implement it twice. Fullscreen
// earns its place because presentation mode cannot work without it; `screens()`
// because placing a deck on the projector is the first capability whose absence
// callers must handle. The next method, when something actually needs it, is:
//
//   keepAwake(): Promise<() => void>    // navigator.wakeLock / powerSaveBlocker
//
// deliberately absent today — see #195. It is named here only so the next author
// knows the interface was left open on purpose rather than considered finished.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
