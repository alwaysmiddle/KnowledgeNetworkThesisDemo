// THE PROJECTOR CHANNEL — how the presenter's window tells the room's window what
// to show (#267 OB-135 clause 2/3, #197's architecture).
//
// TWO WINDOWS, NOT TWO DISPLAYS. The presenter screen stays in the app's own
// window; starting a lecture opens a SECOND window of this same app at
// `?projector`, which renders only the live slide, full-bleed, and nothing else.
// Where that window lands — the laptop, the projector — is the OS's or the
// professor's to decide; display placement is an enhancement layered on later
// (#204), never the mechanism. That is how Google Slides, Figma, Canva and
// reveal.js all ship it, and it works on one monitor or three.
//
// THE TRANSPORT IS `BroadcastChannel`: both windows are same-origin, so it needs
// no window handle and survives either window reloading. reveal.js reaches for
// `postMessage` only because it must cross origins; we do not.
//
// A HANDSHAKE BEFORE STATE (reveal.js's `connect` / `connected`). The projector
// window opens AFTER the presenter has state, so it would otherwise open blank
// on a slide nobody chose. The projector says `connect` when it is ready; the
// presenter answers `connected` and then the current state; from then on every
// change is a `state`. A second projector window (a reload, a second screen)
// joins the same way. The presenter DRIVES — the projector never sends a seek.
//
// `close` is the presenter leaving: the projector window closes itself, so a
// screen nobody is watching is not left showing a slide (#197: closing one
// window closes the other).
