// THE PRESENTER SCREEN — the professor's own view of a walk while it is taught:
// the header bar, the film roll, the strip and the finder on ONE store (#267,
// DS OB-135/136/137/138, parts 1–4 of the presenter-mode split). Ported from the
// DS's reference host `templates/studio/PresenterScreen.jsx`, with the Studio's
// bindings translated and its wiring kept.
//
// WHERE IT SITS. StudioView mounts it as its presenter MODE (owner, 2026-09-03):
// while a lecture is LIVE (projecting and not ended) it takes the whole area under
// nothing — app header, toolbar and palette are gone and this bar is the chrome;
// as a PREVIEW (the palette's Present, `projecting={false}`) or once ENDED it sits
// framed beside the palette with the chrome kept, so ending is always a way home.
//
// THE STORE — the three facts and the transient UI, all here. `activeStop` is the
// record, `roamingStop` where the professor is looking, `covered` what was
// presented (a stop is covered when the record LEAVES it). Components ask; this
// decides. THE LECTURE IS THE WALK BEING PLAYED — `useWalkPlayback`'s steps, the
// saved walk if one is active and the desk's road otherwise — and it starts at
// the Studio's focus, reporting the shown stop back to the bus so the header's
// focus follows the lecture.
//
// WHAT IS PROJECTED (clause 2): the roll's live card content — the slide — goes
// to the projector window through `useProjectorSender`; the preview projects
// nothing, so the room's window shows dark.
//
// THE PANES ROW (parts 6 and 7): the notes pane and the quick actions deck,
// side by side under the strip, and the deck's column is the same 360 the recap
// keeps for its flagged list — so nothing moves sideways when the lecture ends.
// Both are the DS's components and both store NOTHING: what the professor writes,
// mints and rearranges lives in `lecturenotes.ts` (per walk for the notes, per
// user for the categories and the furniture) and is handed back down as props.
//
// PART 8, THE RECAP, REPLACES THE WHOLE ROW when the lecture ends, with the same
// notes in `review` shape beside what was flagged.
