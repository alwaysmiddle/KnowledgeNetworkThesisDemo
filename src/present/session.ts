// PRESENTING AS A SESSION — the mode flag, the host's fullscreen bit, and the
// keys that drive a deck. No rendering; PresentationFrame.tsx does that.
//
// TWO FLAGS, DELIBERATELY INDEPENDENT.
//
//   `presenting` is OURS: chrome off, the deck on screen, keys bound.
//   `fullscreen` is the HOST'S: whether the window is actually filling the display.
//
// Collapsing them into one would be wrong in both directions. Fullscreen can be
// refused — by policy, by an iframe, by a browser that wants a different gesture
// — and a deck that refuses to start because of that is worse than a deck in a
// window. And the user can leave fullscreen at any moment by pressing F11 or
// Escape, which must not end the presentation: they are un-maximising a window,
// not walking off stage. So `presenting` is state we own and `fullscreen` is a
// value we only ever mirror from the host.
