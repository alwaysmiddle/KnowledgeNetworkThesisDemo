// WHAT A LECTURE LEAVES BEHIND — the notes taken while teaching, the prepared
// notes the professor edited at the lectern, the categories they minted, and the
// shape they dragged the quick actions deck into (#267, parts 6–8).
//
// TWO SCOPES, AND THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THIS FILE:
//
//   · PER LECTURE — the notes and the prepared-note edits. They are about ONE
//     walk's stops, so they are keyed by the walk. Teaching a different walk
//     opens a different notebook; teaching the same one again next term opens
//     the one with last term's notes in it.
//   · USER-WIDE — the minted categories and the habits (the divider's position,
//     where the shelf was dropped, which actions are on the deck). A category
//     the professor minted at one stop belongs to THEM, not to the stop, the
//     walk or the lecture; the DS's `LectureNotes` says so in its contract and
//     this is the half that keeps the promise.
//
// PREPARED NOTES ARE AN OVERLAY, NOT AN EDIT OF THE CORPUS. A walk's stop note
// is authored on the desk, and there is no draft op that writes one from here —
// so the pencil in the notes pane writes into `prepared` in this store, keyed by
// the stop's id, and the pane is handed the override where one exists and the
// stop's own note otherwise. That is a deliberately smaller promise than
// "editing the walk": it means a lectern correction survives the lecture and the
// browser without silently rewriting authored material behind the author's back.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS. Every read and write is wrapped: a private-mode browser,
// a full quota or a corrupted value must cost the professor their persistence,
// never their lecture.
