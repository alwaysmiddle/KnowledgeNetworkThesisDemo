// WHAT A LECTURE IS MADE OF — the pure half of presenter mode (#267, DS OB-135).
//
// A lecture is the walk being played (`useWalkPlayback`'s steps: the saved walk if
// one is active, else the road open on the desk), read once into the shape the
// presenter's four parts share: a title, the stop's TERRITORY (its domain's name,
// what the strip's breadcrumb and the finder's outline group by), the territory's
// ring hue, the stop's note (what the slide prints), and the walk's name (the
// slide's foot). No React here — `PresenterScreen.tsx` holds the store, this
// holds the arithmetic it reads, so the arithmetic can be asked directly.
//
// THREE FACTS THE SCREEN KEEPS, named here because every part reads them the
// same way (DS PresenterStrip.d.ts): `activeStop` is the lecture's committed
// record — where the class is; `roamingStop` is where the professor is LOOKING,
// provisional, null when not roaming; `covered` is what was actually presented —
// a stop is covered when the record LEAVES it, so a skip is a gap in the fill.
