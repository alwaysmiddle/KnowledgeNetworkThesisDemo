// OB-107 — the arithmetic behind bowing a walk arrow on the map, kept out of the
// component so it can be tested against real coordinates instead of eyeballed in
// a screenshot.
//
// `NodeArrow`'s `bow` is a signed offset of the shaft's midpoint PERPENDICULAR TO
// ITS OWN AXIS, and the map draws every walk arrow inside a `rotate(angle)` of its
// own — so a sign that separates two lines in one arrow's frame can put them on
// the same side of the map. Both functions here work in the map's WORLD
// coordinates, which is the only frame in which "do these two lines run together"
// is a real question.
