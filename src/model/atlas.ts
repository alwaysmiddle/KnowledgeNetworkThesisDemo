/** WHERE A WALK STOP SITS ON THE MAP AT A GIVEN LEVEL, and the one rule that
 * decides whether it is drawn at all.
 *
 * The map is an atlas: at level k the level-k nodes ARE the cells. A walk's
 * stops are corpus nodes at whatever depth the author picked, so almost none of
 * them owns a cell at the level currently on screen, and each has to resolve to
 * something that does. The answer is the DEEPEST ancestor — the stop itself
 * counting as its own — whose cell is at or above this stratum.
 *
 * WHY IT WALKS THE CHAIN INSTEAD OF INDEXING IT. The obvious form, and the one
 * this replaced, is `pathTo(id)[level + 1]`: take the ancestor sitting exactly
 * `level` steps down. That reads well and is wrong twice, both silently
 * (OB-109).
 *
 * 1. CONTAINMENT DEPTH IS NOT CELL TIER. `pathTo` counts containers; `tier`
 *    counts grain. `auto-continuous-integration` is 4 deep
 *    (root/se/tool/auto/…) and owns a TIER-2 cell, because `auto` is a container
 *    the atlas never gives a cell to — `flightTargetOf('auto')` is null. At L2
 *    the index landed on `auto`, got null, and dropped the stop.
 * 2. THE INDEX RUNS OFF THE END. Once the level is deeper than the stop, there
 *    is no ancestor at that index at all. The demo corpus carries territories to
 *    tier 6 while a walk's stops are tier-2 topics, so from L3 down EVERY stop
 *    resolved to `undefined` and the entire walk — pins and arrows — left the
 *    map with no warning.
 *
 * Walking up from the stop and taking the first ancestor with `tier <= level`
 * answers both: it skips cell-less containers instead of failing on them, and it
 * stops at the stop itself when nothing coarser is needed.
 *
 * A STOP COARSER THAN THE GRAIN ON SCREEN STILL HAS A PLACE. Its own cell is no
 * longer drawn and its children's are, so it anchors on its own centroid — a
 * point inside the union of the cells its children now tile. Nothing untrue is
 * claimed: the walk does pass through here, and the arrows between stops still
 * join two real positions. That is the deliberate, documented choice OB-109 asks
 * for in place of a level where stops silently stop drawing.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT the choice the search-match tally in MapView makes. A
 * match that is an ancestor of the whole stratum is a COUNT ("3 matches under
 * Systems Programming"), and a count has nowhere to land once its cell is gone.
 * A walk stop is a single place, so it always has a centroid to sit on.
 *
 * `null` only for an id the map has never heard of. */

/** WHERE A PIN GOES WHEN THE GROUND IT WANTS IS ALREADY SPOKEN FOR.
 *
 * A territory's name is drawn across its centre, and a walk pin is drawn at that
 * same centre. The pin is a filled disc with a step number in it — an opaque
 * mark, not a wash — so it does not dim the name underneath, it deletes it
 * (OB-108: pin 6 over "Cryptography", pin 7 over "Turing", the "1-4" pin over
 * "Digital Logic").
 *
 * NOT AN OPACITY PROBLEM, and the design system says why: lowering the pin's
 * opacity to let the label through also lowers the contrast of the number inside
 * it, which is the one thing the pin exists to show clearly. The mark has to move
 * instead.
 *
 * IT TAKES EVERY LABEL ON SCREEN, NOT THE PIN'S OWN. OB-108 is worded as "its own
 * territory's label", and that is the case its screenshots show — but it is only
 * the shallow half of the problem. Zoom past the level where a stop owns a cell
 * and the stop keeps its pin (see `walkAnchorAt`) while the ground under it is
 * re-tiled by its CHILDREN, each with a name of its own. Its own label is gone by
 * then; the pin lands on someone else’s. Same fault, same solid disc over a word,
 * and a per-id check cannot see it. So the caller hands in the labels actually
 * drawn at this level and the search clears them all — which satisfies OB-108’s
 * own case as a subset.
 *
 * The search steps outward from `from` in a ring of directions and returns the
 * first position that is inside the cell AND clear of every box, preferring —
 * among the candidates at the radius that first works — the one with the most
 * room around it. Stepping outward keeps the displacement small; picking the
 * roomiest at that radius stops a pin from ending up wedged against the end of a
 * word, which technically clears the box and reads as a collision anyway.
 *
 * Returns `from` unchanged when it already clears everything, and gives up — also
 * returning `from` — when no candidate works. A pin outside its own territory
 * would be a worse lie than one over a word, and at deep zoom the parent
 * watermark alone can cover a whole region, so giving up has to stay an option
 * rather than becoming a shove.
 *
 * `radius` is the pin’s own half-width in world units; every box is grown by it
 * so a disc-versus-box test becomes a point-versus-box one. */
