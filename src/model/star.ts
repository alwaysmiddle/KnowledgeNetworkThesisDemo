// ── The region star (2026-07-15, SelfNotes item A) ───────────────────────────
// Above the topic grain starFor is EMPTY by design — a domain has no relations
// of its own. But the MAP rolls a domain's underlying topic edges up into roads
// and draws them, so the pane going blank there was a real asymmetry: the notes'
// "external view shows nothing" when a whole region is selected.
//
// The fix reads that same edge set as a one-hop ego graph, centred on the
// region: the counterparts are the individual OUTSIDE topics the region's members
// link to, one strand per real typed edge.
//
// THERE WAS A SECOND GRAIN, AND IT IS GONE (2026-09-07, #290). `summary` rolled the
// same edges up to one arrow per other REGION — the star of the map's roads, same
// rollup, same compass — behind a toggle on the graph. #253's rehaul retired the
// toggle and with it the only screen that ever asked for the grain, and it cannot
// come back to that pane: the pane's whole mechanism is that hovering a card lights
// its node in the graph and the other way round, so both surfaces have to name the
// same ids — and a summary node IS a region while every card's target is a topic.
// Deleted rather than left unreachable. Its shape and the reasoning are on #290.

// Region centres — the raw centroids the map's roads leave from (mirrors
// atlas.ts:38-39). Recomputed here, not imported, to keep star a self-contained
// pure model; the formula is identical, so a region lands on the same bearing in
// both views.
