//
// A name whose best split still overflows is DROPPED. Not every place is named
// at every scale; zooming in names it, and the hover tooltip always has it.
// force=true (the parent watermark ghost) returns its best split regardless:
// orientation text may bleed, it must not vanish.

/** The box a fitted label actually occupies, in world units — the union of its
 *  lines' own boxes.
 *
 *  It lives HERE because it is the same measurement `fitLabel` already makes:
 *  a line's width is `text.length * fs * CHAR_W`, and `CHAR_W` is this module's
 *  private constant. A caller that needed a label's extent would have to retype
 *  that number, and the two would drift the first time the UI font changed.
 *
 *  `x` on a `FitLine` is the line's CENTRE (the text is drawn `text-anchor:
 *  middle`) and `y` is its BASELINE, so the box runs half a width either side of
 *  x, and from roughly four-fifths of the font size above the baseline to a
 *  fifth below it — cap height up, descender down. Approximate on purpose: this
 *  is used to keep other marks off the text, where being a pixel generous is
 *  free and being a pixel mean is the bug. */

// the honest region chord (regionChordAt — non-convex, multi-ring), with one
// extra lever the territory labels don't need: these are the ONLY names on

// step by step until the best split fits (floored — below ~½ size a name is
// noise, and an honest small bleed beats an absent name).
