//
// The one thing here that is genuinely easy to get backwards, and that a
// screenshot would only tell you about after the fact: WHICH WAY to bow the two
// lines at a pin the walk doubles back through. The DS proposed alternating the
// sign. That is right for two lines both POINTING AT a shared pin, and wrong for
// a walk, because a walk is a path — its two lines travel in OPPOSITE directions
// through the pin, and `bow` is signed in each arrow's own rotated frame. So the
// same sign puts them on opposite sides of the corridor and the alternating one
// stacks them.
//
// The last test measures that on the drawn curves instead of reasoning about it.
