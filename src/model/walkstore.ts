// The walk registry (#16) — every walk the app knows about, built-in or authored.
//
// `corpus/walks.ts` holds two hand-written walks as a module const, guarded at
// load: every stop must be a real topic or the module throws. That is right for
// shipped data and wrong for user data, which arrives from storage long after
// the corpus was compiled and must never be able to white-screen the app. So
// this file is the seam: WALKS stays exactly what it is, and everything that
// asks "what walks are there" asks HERE instead, where the answer is the
// built-ins plus whatever the Walk·Desk has saved.
//
// It is pure and synchronous like the rest of src/model — no React. The store is
// the same tiny subscribe/notify shape authordraft.ts uses; the two React
// consumers bind it with useSyncExternalStore themselves, which is one line each
// and keeps a hook out of the model layer.
//
// `list()` returns a CACHED array, rebuilt only when the saved set changes.
// useSyncExternalStore compares snapshots by identity and would loop forever on
// a getter that composed a fresh array every call.

// reading order with no such state — a hole in it is just a broken stop — so a
// stop that no longer resolves is DROPPED, and a walk left with nothing is
// dropped whole.
