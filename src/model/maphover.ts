// WHICH HOVER THE MAP DRAWS, AND HOW — the map has two hover sources, and they
// do not get the same treatment.
//
// One is the pointer physically over this pane. The other arrives on the bus: a
// row the user is pointing at in the tree, or in the connections pane, republished
// here as "the thing your cursor is on over there lives HERE". Both light a
// territory. Only the first one gets a card.
//
// OB-127 (#251) is the ruling that made that asymmetry a rule rather than an
// accident. We had asked the Design System whether `MapTooltip` anchors to the
// cursor or to the hovered element, and offered both. The answer was neither: the
// card is FOR a cursor hover, so the question dissolves. On a published hover the
// pointer is over the OTHER pane, which is already drawing its own treatment for a
// name the user is reading there; what they want from the map is where the thing
// is, and the lit territory answers that completely. A card would repeat a name
// they are already looking at, on a surface they are not looking at.
//
// It lives in its own file, out of the component, for the reason `walkpins.ts`
// does: this is a rule that keeps being re-decided. Three obligations have moved
// it already — OB-095 deleted the fixed top-left hover chip, OB-096 replaced it
// with the cursor-anchored card, OB-127 now takes that card away from half its
// inputs — and a fourth is queued: OB-131 (#246) mounts `WalkDock` on this same
// pane and adds a precedence rule between this card and the walk's preview. A rule
// that is a named function can be asserted; the same condition inline in a
// 1300-line render can only be argued from a screenshot.
