// THE ROUTE THE BUS PUBLISHES, WITH ITS GROUPS INTACT (#228, DS OB-114).
//
// The walk desk holds a walk as a TREE — steps, and containers holding steps —
// and a resolved container stays a named group rather than being spliced inline
// (#19). Until this file, the bus flattened that tree to `leafIds()` before any
// instrument saw it, so every group boundary was destroyed one layer below the
// map: a group at step 3 holding three nodes numbered its nodes 3, 4, 5 and the
// step after the group came out 6, while the desk's own chain read 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
// and 4. Two views of one walk disagreed about how many steps it had.
//
// THE CHANNEL SHAPE, decided 2026-09-03 (issue #228, the DS's stated preference):
// the bus publishes the resolved TREE, and the flat route every current reader
// wants stays as a DERIVED projection of it (`routeLeafIds`), so no reader
// changes. A parallel `routeGroups` array would be the same information held at
// a distance from the thing it describes, which is the shape that goes stale
// silently; a derived numbering channel would encode one consumer's question
// into the transport. The bus owns this small type rather than the desk's `Stop`
// (whose own header calls it throwaway spike data): a step either lands on a
// node or holds steps of its own, read from its shape the way the desk reads
// leaf-vs-container.
//
// WHAT THE MAP DRAWS FOR A GROUP, ruled by the owner 2026-09-03 (DS OB-114): one
// pin PER NODE, each numbered with the group's TOP-LEVEL step. Never one averaged
// pin (a pin where the walk never goes is a lie), never "3.1" on a pin (it takes
// StepDot's pill branch and reads as a range; a nested path fits no circle). The
// full path is the HOVER's — the preview card names the stop "3.1 · <name>" — and
// the chain's, where there is room. Consequences, all deliberate: several map
// pins may share a number, and a pin's number is NOT an id — nothing keys on it.
