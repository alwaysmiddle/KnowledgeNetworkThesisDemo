// Everything this app has written to localStorage, as one list — and one way to
// clear it.
//
// TEMPORARY (2026-08-22): built to answer "why did my persisted state break?"
// and to get out of a browser that is already holding a payload the current code
// cannot use. The button that calls it is marked the same way in
// src/instruments/walkdesk/WalkActionBar.tsx. Delete both together.
//
// WHY A PREFIX SWEEP AND NOT THREE NAMED KEYS. Three modules persist things —
// draftpersist.ts (`pkt.walkdesk.draft`), walkstore.ts (`pkt.walks.saved`) and
// ui/floatingPanelRect.ts (`pkt.floating-panel.<id>`, one per panel). Importing
// each module's key would clear exactly the keys the CURRENT code knows the
// names of, which is the one set that is guaranteed not to include the problem:
// a key goes ORPHAN the moment the feature that wrote it is retired, and nothing
// then names it. #144 retired WalkToolbox and its FloatingPanel with it, so
// whatever `pkt.floating-panel.<toolbox-id>` that panel last wrote is still in
// the browser with no module left that could ask for it. Sweeping the shared
// `pkt.` prefix is what reaches those.
//
// WHY THE PAYLOADS CANNOT SAY WHAT THEY ARE. None of the three carries a version
// or schema field — a stored draft is the bare `DraftSnapshot` shape, a stored
// walk list is a bare array. So when a payload's shape and the reader's
// expectations drift apart, the reader cannot tell "written by an older build"
// from "corrupt", and both readers already had to pick a silent answer:
// draftpersist repairs what it can and falls back to the seed on structural
// damage, walkstore drops the members it cannot read. Neither can report that it
// happened, and neither can migrate. That is the whole reason a stale payload
// presents as "my plan is wrong" rather than as an error — and it is why this
// file's real job is `listStoredData`, not `clearStoredData`: seeing the bytes is
// the diagnosis, clearing them is only the escape hatch.
