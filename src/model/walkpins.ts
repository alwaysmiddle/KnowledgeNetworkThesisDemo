// WHERE THE WALK'S NUMBERED PINS GO ON THE MAP — the whole decision, in one
// pure function, out of the component that draws it.
//
// It used to be two `useMemo`s inside `MapView` (`routeVis` and `routeStops`).
// It is here because four separate obligations have now rewritten the same
// arithmetic — OB-069's revisit rule, OB-087's crowding spread, OB-108's label
// clearance, OB-109's deep-level clamp — and each one had to be argued from a
// screenshot, because a memo closed over React state cannot be called with a
// walk and a level and asked what it would draw. The DS's house rule for this
// code says it plainly: two more items (OB-114, OB-132) are queued against it
// and "both rewrite whatever function builds the list of pins to draw". A named
// function is what stops the next one re-deriving this one.
//
// THE PIPELINE, AND WHY IT IS IN THIS ORDER. Every stage can move a pin, and
// each one can undo the one before it, so the order is the design:
//
//   1. RESOLVE      each stop to the cell that is actually on screen at this
//                   level (`walkAnchorAt`) — deep stops roll up to an ancestor,
//                   shallow ones clamp onto their own centroid.
//   2. MERGE        a contiguous run of stops on one cell becomes ONE pin with a
//                   range label ("1-3"); a later return to the same cell stays a
//                   separate pin (OB-069).
//   3. CROWD        how many pins are competing for the same piece of screen —
//                   which fixes the size they are all drawn at.
//   4. FAN          pins that want the exact same point get spread around it.
//   5. CLEAR LABELS nudge each pin off any name it would otherwise delete
//                   (OB-108). Runs after the fan, never before: run the other
//                   way round it takes a fanned pin and puts it back on the text.
//   6. SEPARATE     the guarantee, and it runs LAST because stages 4 and 5 are
//                   both allowed to move a pin toward its neighbour.
//
// STAGE 3 IS OB-128 AND IT REPLACES A NARROWER RULE. Crowding used to be counted
// per CELL: two pins were a crowd only if the map had resolved them to the same
// region. The DS's correction states the rule the other way round and says it is
// not to be read narrowly — "crowding is a property of the DRAWN POSITION, not
// of the node". Two stops on two different but adjacent cells are just as much
// on top of each other as two stops on one cell; the viewer cannot see which
// case they are looking at, and a rule keyed on identity cannot see the first.
// So the count is taken over pins whose discs would actually touch.
//
// STAGE 6 IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE SAME OBLIGATION, and it exists because
// counting correctly is not the same as drawing correctly. The fan and the label
// nudge each move pins for their own good reasons and neither checks the other's
// result — MapView's own comment admitted the hole ("in principle two spread
// pins could be pushed toward each other"). The done-when is a statement about
// the finished picture, so the check belongs at the end of the pipeline, where
// nothing can come after it and reintroduce the fault.
