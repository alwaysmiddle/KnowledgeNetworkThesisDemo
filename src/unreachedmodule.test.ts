// unreachedmodule.test.ts — every module in the app's own folders is reached by
// something, or says in writing why it is not.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. #214 was filed against `src/present/PresentationFrame.tsx`,
// quoting its header and pointing at the early return that mounted it. By the time
// anyone read that issue the file rendered nowhere: #267 replaced the deck with the
// presenter and left the old one standing. So the issue described, in detail and in
// good faith, code that could not run — and the only way to find that out was to grep
// for the filename and notice the silence.
//
// A component nothing renders is worse than clutter. It answers questions wrongly:
// it turns up in searches, it gets read as current, it gets cited in tickets, and its
// comments go on asserting things about an app that has moved on. This is the cheapest
// possible check that it cannot happen quietly again.
//
// It is deliberately narrow — the three folders that hold this app's own screens. It
// does not police src/ds, where the barrel re-exports everything by design and
// "ported, not yet adopted" is a tracked state with its own ledger in barrel.test.ts.
