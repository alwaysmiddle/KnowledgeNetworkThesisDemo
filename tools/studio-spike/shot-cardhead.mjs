// Verification for the DS-head merge on the Railroad's open container card (#91).
// The card's head is now the DS VersionedGroup head — mono outline, display-font
// title wrapping to two lines, an always-visible tally, the DescLine, and the DS
// version picker with its drawn tick and caret.
//
// The head STOPPED being a fixed 72px. headRows() predicts its height from the
// text, layoutRoad reserves that, and the render pass draws each row at the same
// number. That prediction is the only thing that can go wrong, and it fails in
// one visible way: an under-reserved head runs into the steps placed beneath it,
// because those steps are board-level siblings positioned from the reserved
// height, not flowed after the head.
//
// So the assertion is exactly that: NO head rectangle may overlap any node or
// card rectangle other than its own. Everything else about the merge is visual
// and rides in the screenshots.
//
// Same server-owning idiom as shot-nested.mjs beside this file — this process
// starts vite, drives it, and kills it, so nothing is left running.
