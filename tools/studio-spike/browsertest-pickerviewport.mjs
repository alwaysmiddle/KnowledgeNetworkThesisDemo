// browsertest-pickerviewport.mjs — a node picker's menu opens where you can reach it.
//
// A TEST. It was not one until 2026-09-03: this began as `drive-pickerviewport.mjs`,
// an investigation into whether `NodePicker` can open its menu off the bottom of the
// window. It measured and PRINTED, printing "!! THE MENU RUNS Npx OFF THE BOTTOM —
// that is the bug" on the bad path and exiting 0 either way. So it could not fail,
// and `run-browsertests.mjs` counted it as a passing test.
//
// WHAT IT SUSPECTED, AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE NOW. It was written believing
// `NodePicker` anchors its menu at `rect.bottom + 4` unconditionally, with no
// viewport-edge flip, in our port AND in the Design System source — so a picker low
// in the pane could open a menu running off the bottom of the screen. That was real:
// measured at the time as 280px of menu with 46px off-screen and 7 of 53 rows
// reachable.
//
// IT HAS SINCE BEEN FIXED, and the investigation was never updated to say so. Our
// `NodePicker.tsx` now carries a `★ LOCAL` divergence — `placeMenu()` — which flips
// the menu above the anchor when there is no room below AND caps its height to the
// room it has on that side. Both terms are needed: flipping alone still overran by
// 46px in the measured case. The DS source still has neither; the divergence is
// marked to be dropped if they adopt it.
//
// SO WHY KEEP THIS FILE. `NodePicker.test.ts` already asserts `placeMenu()`'s
// arithmetic with no browser. That proves the RULE. It cannot prove the rule is
// wired to the real anchor, with the real road geometry, in the real window — which
// is the half that broke in the first place. Same split as `browsertest-maphover.mjs`.
//
// It therefore drives the WORST case rather than a comfortable one: the LAST group
// card on the road, a fresh empty version on it (adding a version GROWS the card and
// pushes the new empty slot further down, so the picker most likely to be opened is
// the one most likely to be near an edge), the picker scrolled to the BOTTOM of its
// scroller, at three window heights. It also asserts that the trigger really did end
// up low, because a height where it did not would prove nothing while still going
// green.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES TODAY: the trigger lands at y=569 at every height, and the menu
// opens BELOW it at 950px (75px to spare) and flips ABOVE it at 800 and 700. The
// flip is doing exactly what it was added to do.
//
// Spawns vite ITSELF — backgrounded dev servers die on this machine.
