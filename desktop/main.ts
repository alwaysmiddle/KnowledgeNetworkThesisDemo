// THE MAIN PROCESS — the only place in this repository where Node exists.
//
// A common misreading of "wrap it in Electron" is that the app now gets Node.
// It does not. Electron's renderer is a Chromium page like any other and never
// has Node; Node lives HERE, and the renderer reaches it only through the
// preload's `contextBridge`. So this file answers three questions and nothing
// else: where do the app's files come from, what window shows them, and what
// can the renderer ask us to do that Chromium cannot do for itself.
//
// Today that last list has exactly one entry — window fullscreen. See #201 for
// the five capabilities that will genuinely need this process later, and #202
// for why this slice deliberately adds no others.

// `app://` AND NOT `file://`, and this is a decision rather than a preference.
// Chromium treats a `file://` page as an opaque origin, and an opaque origin has
// NO localStorage — every `pkt.*` key the app has ever persisted would be
// unreachable in the desktop build, silently, with the app looking merely empty
// rather than broken. A registered standard+secure scheme gets a real origin
// (`app://local`), which gets real storage that survives a restart. The smoke
// test asserts exactly that, because it is the whole reason this line exists.
//
// MUST run before `app.whenReady()`. Afterwards it is a silent no-op — no throw,
// no warning, just a build whose storage quietly stops working.

// methods have to be overridden in the preload as a SET rather than one at a
// time: a window put fullscreen from this process never fires the renderer's
// `fullscreenchange` event, so an inherited web `onFullscreenChange` would be
// quietly dead while `enterFullscreen` appeared to work.

  // says; this is what that costs on this host.
  //
  // The timeout is not a failure path so much as an answer of last resort: a
